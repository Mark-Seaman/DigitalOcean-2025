# College Class vs. Personal Learning

Learning a new technical skill can be done a couple of different ways.  You can take a college class
and have an instructor explain the details, or you can opt to study on your own.  I recently
wrote a book, "Building Python Web Apps", that should help you with either path.

Reading the book and working the exercises requires about 100 hours of concentrated effort and
focused practice. Investing that amount of energy will enable you to build apps on your own
successfully. Additional time is required to get quicker at the skills and get stuck less often,
but this course will prepare you to write commercial apps professionally.

This textbook is also ideal for personal learning outside the classroom. Anyone that invests 100
hours will learn the skills to build a modern web app. This could be used for On-The-Job Training
or professional development.

The internet is full of excellent free resources to help you in specific situations. There are links
throughout this textbook for additional learning content.
