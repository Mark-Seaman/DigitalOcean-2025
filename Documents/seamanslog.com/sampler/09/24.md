# Building a Tweet Farm

I've been writing for a while and built a large collection of articles.  I've been pondering how
I could share this information with more people.  One of the things that has happened with the
adoption of the internet is that our attention span has gotten incredibly short. People no longer
will tolerate long articles unless it is of particular interest.

I believe that there is a hierarchy of acceptance that our brains go through (without our awareness).
There are thousands of messages that we are exposed to each day.  Most of our waking hours are 
spent prioritizing a sea of information to sift through and find what affects me.

As a writer I want to respect this dynamic in order to cater to the preferences of my readers.  I am
now attempting to share larger chunks of writing in smaller portions. If I can get people to read a
tweet of 40 words then they may read a page of 250 words. This is the new normal and I believe
that authors should take advantage of this.
