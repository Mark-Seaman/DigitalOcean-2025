# Meaning of Life - the human spirit

We live in a time when many of us struggle to find meaning in life. It seems like we work a job,
have a family and great hobbies, but still wonder why. How can we ever feel truly satisfied with
the life opportunities we have been given?

Meaning is about finding the purpose for our very existence. Without it we are like ships lost at
sea. Without meaning, we will always seek comfort in unhealthy ways. It is a sense of purpose that
gives us passion and motivation to keep moving forward.

Meaningful work and meaningful relationships are essential to living the good life. Without these, we
are doomed to misery. Both of these areas must be supported by a healthy private life. Constantly
learning and growing allows us to truly appreciate life as it is. Living in the moment and being
ready for the future create meaning in both our work and relationships.
