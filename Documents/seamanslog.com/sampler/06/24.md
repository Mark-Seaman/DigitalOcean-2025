# Programmer

Mark has spent his entire adult life programming. He has well written over
1,000,000 lines of code and continues to write code daily. Building software
brings him great joy and he spends much of his free time trying out new ideas.
Although he has worked commercially in a large number of languages, he prefers
working with Linux, Python, Django.

He has been working on a framework that allows him to go from business idea to a

for a very low cost.

Mark is committed to open source software and makes much of his content open to
the public for free.
