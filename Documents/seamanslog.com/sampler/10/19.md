# Journey of Transformation

Over the past several years I have been immersed in the pursuit of spiritual formation.  This
incorporates the ideas of emotional health, personal honesty, spiritual practices, and time alone
with God.

I've been on a journey of transformation toward wholeness. Each step has required increasing courage
to honestly look at the dysfunctions in my life.  I realize that I have been carrying wounds from
childhood that profoundly affect my life today.

The change in my life has been astounding. I have experienced new freedom to admit what is true and
healing in my relationships as well.  The greatest impact is unseen.  I have an inner peace that I
have never experienced before.  There is a new confidence that if I am faithful to do what I can
that everything else will somehow work out fine.

I no longer have the fear of failure or rejection that I've carried my whole life.  I am confident
that I will achieve what I am destined to do and fully realize my potential.  In the end I will
experience the joy of finishing well.

This has not been a continuous path for me and has been filled with fits and starts.  I have often 
been caught in eddies and currents that threatened to take me to a dark place.  But God is the one
who has initiated this journey and he will take me where I need to be.

I'm better today than I have ever been, but also worse today than I will ever be again!
