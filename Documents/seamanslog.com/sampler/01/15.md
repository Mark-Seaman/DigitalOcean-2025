# What is the  Church?

The church is a visible representation of God's presence on earth.  It
illustrates the authority of God in human life.  The Bible uses the term,
"Kingdom of God", to contrast this with the authority of human empires.   

The church is the community of God's followers.  It is a human organization that
spans all cultures that is built around a common understanding of the Gospel. 
This belief adheres to the  Nicene Creed, which has been the basis of our faith
for the last 1700 years.

The church is a human organization made by humans for humans.  This means that
it is far from perfect. When God is directing the church his authority is in
charge (and his will is done).  But there are often times when the people in
charge reject God's will to meet their own selfish goals.

This war between two kingdoms occurs in every human arena, throughout our
private lives, schools, businesses, government, communities, and even the
church.   The human conflict over whether to pursue God's will or the selfish
goals of people rages at every turn. Some decisions are made in favor of God's
will, while many are made to gain more power and wealth for the people involved.
