# Seaman's Log Sampler Platter

by Mark Seaman

---

Restaurants often have huge menus with many different choices.  This can be overwhelming at times
when I just want to sample a variety of dishes to enjoy.  The sampler platter lets me enjoy several
tasty selections without having to make a lot of choices.

I write a lot of content for different publishing venues.  This includes books, blogs, online
courses, and create videos.  The "Seaman's Log" website is an easy way to be updated on the latest
writing projects.

A short sample is presented along with a link if you are interested in reading more.  Typical 
posts are limited to a page of text but are well connected to additional content.  This serves as
a convenient on-ramp for my other writing venues.

I am updating the site daily to keep the content fresh and replace the older posts with new
content. There are already 365 posts on this site. This website has a new post for each day of
the year.

Each day's post will give you a small sample of my writing.  We will explore a wide 
variety of topics.   

Every time you visit this website you will be given today's post. Enjoy the ride.
