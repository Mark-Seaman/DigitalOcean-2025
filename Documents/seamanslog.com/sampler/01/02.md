# Digital Images

In the late 80s I started working on scanner software and OCR.  In that era the
computers were barely capable of working with image data due to both hardware
and software limitations.

We were building software that went with our scanners.  As the capability of the
hardware and operating systems increased we were quick to build features into
the software that could provide more value to customers.  This sparked the 
most innovative time in my career.

Here are some of technologies that we developed throughout the 90s.

* Software to scan images 
* Sending images directly to other application software
* Automatic image detection and page decomposition
* OCR and word-level recognition
* Creating editable, rich text documents
* Image editing application software
* Automatic image enhancement for color, focus, contrast
* Photo layout application
* Photo management software
* Internet sharing services for photos

I went from being a programmer to being a team leader and expert in software
engineering. My best season was leading a team to build a complete suite of
application software that shipped with our Digital Cameras.  

During this time I was able to 25 invention disclosures and was awarded 12 international patents.
