## One of the best days of my life
* Encouraged
* Inspired
* Informed
* Prepared


### Spent alone with Martin Luther King
* January 18, 2021
* Cleared all other activities
* Open mind and heart
* Searching for answers

### He spoke and I listened
* Deeply troubled by what is happening
* Learn and understand
* Courage to look into the abyss
* Inspiration

### From the mountain top to the deep dark valley
* Best of humanity
* Worst of humanity
* Essential struggle of our age
* If we lose this, we lose everything

### Transformation
* Personal transformation
* Institutions
* Society
* American Dream (for all)

* Elitism or Equity
* As America goes so goes the world

### Bridge the chasm

- Race & Culture Gap
- Generation Gap
- Gender Gap

### Winners and Losers
* Challenge to the privileged
* Work to share Wealth and Power

### History will judge us
* Look at the long view
