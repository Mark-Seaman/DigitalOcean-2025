# Writing Projects

I'm currently writing up a storm.  There are several projects that I've been wanting to pursue for
years but was distracted by building software and teaching college.  Since UNC classes ended in
December I have had the amazing opportunity to write full-time.

This has been a personal dream of mine and now I can make it a reality.  As I am creating content,
it is fun to communicate with others and show them what I am writing.  This can be a time-consuming
task and one that falls outside of my strengths and passion.

I've created a blog about writing to help me keep others updated without filling your inbox with
spam or otherwise becoming annoying.  I've created Seaman's Log to keep anyone interested in what
I'm doing.  

I'm writing and publishing about four pages of content every day.  But my time is split between a
lot of different projects.  I'm currently writing three books and four blogs.

Seaman's Log has a new page each day highlighting a featured article.  These links provide
single-click access to the full content that is published online. They also include a small sample
so that you can decide if you want to read the entire article.

Check it out and let me know what you think.
