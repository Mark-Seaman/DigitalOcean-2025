# Systemic Racism

This is the best presentation of the problem of Systemic Racism that I have ever seen.

Phil Vischer is an author and filmmaker.  He is the co-creator of the kids' programs called "Veggie Tales".  

This video is 17 minutes and extremely well done. Watching this may just change your life.
