# John Wycliffe

I have always been fascinated by the stories of the radical movements throughout
history, that brought us the modern bible that we read today.  Many of these men
were
martyred as heretics for their opposition to the established authority.  

One of my favorite characters is John Wycliffe.  Born in the 1320s Wycliffe
survived the Black Death and faced a society that was dominated by an evil
church structure. The Dark Ages were ruled by a string of bad popes from
767-1534.  These men committed every atrocity forbidden by the 10 Commandments. 
In 1378 there were two popes ruling simultaneously and a third was added in
1409.

John Wycliffe was a priest in England that opposed the corruption of the ruling
leaders and the church of the time.  He became increasingly vocal about the
excesses of clergy and and the godlessness of the church.  He began translating
the scripture into English from Latin so that the common people could read it.

A council was convened in 1414 to select a single Pope.  They also declared John
Wycliffe and his follower Jan Hus in Prague heretics. Wycliffe had already died
but his body was exhumed and burned. Jan Hus was burned alive. All of their
followers were hunted and persecuted and many executed by being burned alive. 
Wycliffe's writings fueled the Reformation movement almost 100 years later.
