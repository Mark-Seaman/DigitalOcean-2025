# True Confessions

When I tell people I am writing an autobiography, they often seem to think that
it is some sort of vanity project.  Why would anyone have the temerity to write
a book about themselves?  Who would want to read such a thing?

The approach that I have taken is anything but a trumpet-blowing exercise to 
garner adulation. Instead, I treat this as a confessional where I can come to
grips with my own brokenness.  I have spent years being very guarded and 
self-protective, but age has made me willing to let the guard down.

I have spent six decades in the School of Hard Knocks and I must have the 
equivalent of a Ph.D.  Success has often come easy to me and I have been able
to chalk up many accomplishments.   But I've also had some colossal failures
that have produced great pain for me and others.

In this book, I intend to be brutally honest and not soft-sell the truth.  I
believe that everyone is broken at a fundamental level.  Each person's flaws
are different but everyone has them.

Our brokenness is where we find our true humanity. Many people spend their 
entire lives running from the brokenness, but for those who have the courage
to take a good hard look, there is healing.   It is my hope that reading about
my struggles will help you in dealing with your own.
