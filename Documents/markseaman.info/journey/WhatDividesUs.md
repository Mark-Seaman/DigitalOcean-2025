# Why Politics Divide Us

Politics is the discussion of things that create conflict

- Reasonable people will disagree about certain topics
- Proposed Solutions are based on the problems being solved
- Everyone starts with their own frame of reference
- My solutions will always address the problems that I feel are most pressing

Opinions are developed over a lifetime

- We all value things differently
- We all value stopping our current pain the most
- We all under-value stopping the pain of others
- Humans are deeply selfish

All classic political conflicts come down to who gets the benefits and who gets left out

- These benefits may be power, wealth, protection, freedom or life itself
- More for me will mean less for you
- Politics is the necessary conflict over who will thrive
- When done well we all agree to share the benefits
- We done poorly the rich and powerful take everything for themselves

History in the US is driven by socio-economic and political cycles

- Over the course of each cycle things become increasingly polarized
- We are at that moment in history now
- Honest debate ends and is replaced by single-minded focus on everyone getting more for themselves

Out with the old in with the new

- In a democracy we often conduct the conflict in relatively peaceful terms
- Once the old system fails to work for everyone it must be dismantled and replaced
- This usually happens in a major war which destroys the old power systems and allows new ones to emerge (Revolutionary War, Civil War, World War II).

What's next

- We are going into a time of intense social upheaval
- Our political system will become completely dysfunctional leading to intense anger and outrage
- Eventually new leaders will arise with the blueprint for the new cycle
- The balance of power will shift dramatically as a result and this will spark a new round of prosperity and growth as things begin working again


What separates us?

Prejudice is universal
- People quickly find a distinction
- They draw a line and define US vs. THEM
- The specifics don't matter
- Hatred quickly forms

Prejudice is not allowed in God's kingdom
- God's love is available to all
- His followers are required to love everyone
- This is completely against our nature
- The Spirit must transform our thinking

What are the major divisions?
- Culture - race, language, attitudes, experiences
- Money - wealth, power, justice, protection
- Age - life experience, trust, opportunity, leadership
- Gender - opportunity, recognition, dominance, constraints

How will you respond personally?
- Are you willing to see your own prejudice?
- What friends do you have that are unlike you?
- What is your next step?
- What does it mean to be "given the ministry of reconciliation‚Äù?
