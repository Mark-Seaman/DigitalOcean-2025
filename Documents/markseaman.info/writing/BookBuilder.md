## About Book Builder

A software tool for authors

Book Builder is a website for authors wishing to create the contents of a published
book.  Throughout the development readers will be able to enjoy the partially
finished work while it is still being written.

This blurs the line between published and unpublished content.  I like to think
of this process as incremental publishing.


## Overview

Book Builder is a website for authors wishing to create the contents of a published
book.  Throughout the development readers will be able to enjoy the partially
finished work while it is still being written.

This blurs the line between published and unpublished content.  I like to think
of this process as incremental publishing.


## Kindle Output

The website is capable of producing a Kindle e-book file in MOBI format.  This
file can be uploaded to the Amazon Kindle Store for sales.  


## Version Control

During development it is critical to record all versions of the book content.
This prevents accidental loss of content during the development.  It also allow
the author to compare two snapshots of the content at any time.

Book builder is 
built on a robust version control system called Github. The author creates 
content that is placed in a version control repository at Github.  There is 
website access to Github for more simple edits.

More complex editing is done by pulling the entire repository down onto any 
computer and then synchronizing the files back to Github.


## One Button to Update Book

Book Builder maintains a link to the author's Github repository.  This allows
the author to pull an updated version of the book content from the repository
onto the Book Builder server.

This effectively creates a "One Button Publishing" process for instant publication
of content.  Changes are brought in from the author repository but no changes
are made to the repository.  This one-way link guarantees the security of the
content in the author's repository.
