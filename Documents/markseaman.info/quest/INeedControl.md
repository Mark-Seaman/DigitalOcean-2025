# I Need Control

The original sin is the choice to try to become God.  The temptation is to
disregard God's will for my life and take whatever action gain control. The
desire for power manifests itself in hundreds of different ways.

God is King and his authority rightfully extends over all of creation.  However,
we live in an age under the corrupted authority of the Prince of Darkness who is
a usurper to God's throne.  We do see God's kingdom in parts of our daily lives,
but the immense suffering all around us is a reminder that God's kingdom laws
are not fully in place.

We have a promise that we will experience life under the sole authority of God's
grace, love, and mercy.  There will be a day where there is no more suffering
but today is not that day.  Our daily lives are filled with painful experiences
from the dark kingdom and joy from the light kingdom.

My heart reflects this cosmic struggle. I desire to do what is right (God is
king), but I end up not doing it (I will be king).  The rebellion that occurred
in the garden is the same rebellion that rages daily in my heart.  Ultimately
this is the desire to BE God rather than to DO God's will.

The key issue is one of control.  Who gets control, Me or God.  Every sin comes
down to this critical choice. The way I typically resolve this is to follow
God's rule whenever it is aligned with my will. This allows me to claim all
for the benefits that result from living a godly life while not having to give
up control.

This only breaks down when God's will goes in a different direction that mine. 
Now I have a big decision: Rebel or Submit. Fight or Yield.  There is no middle
ground. God is king or I am king.

I admit that this does not sound very holy.  That is precisely why I go to such
great lengths to hide my sin.  I still want others to see me as someone who is
following God.  In fact, the more sinful I become the more noise I will make
about what I am doing to please him. 

This is what make religious people so nasty to others. Open rebellion to the
king is replace with hidden rebellion, which usually wears a religious mask.
Jesus is calling each of us to follow and die to our plans so that we can be
alive to him.

Religion is a false following of Jesus, for the purpose of appearing holy while
being wholly devoted to sin. My will, not your will be done. Jesus was happier
in the midsts of drunkards and prostitutes that with religious people. I would
speculate that this is because they were less sinful.

Repentance is something that takes place deep within our spirit.  It does not
occur once but continually.  Following Jesus is an act of submission, or more
pointedly, is a process of submission.  

If I have a moment of true repentance and a deep desire to follow Jesus then I
am living in God's kingdom.  But later as it becomes clearer that he will not
let my be in control I may have second thoughts.  Now I have a big decision:
Rebel or Submit. Fight or Yield.  There is no middle ground. God is king or I am
king.

This could be my moment to lead a rebellion.  This is likely to be a secret
rebellion so that I still claim to be following the king while I establish my
own kingdom.  Am I following Jesus at that point?  I'll let God be the judge.



In time of crisis it is critical to focus on those things that are within my control.

There are many things that are outside my control.   I consciously choose to decide not to think about them.

I control what I think, feel, say, and do.   I will put all of my effort there.

What I Think
- What I consume and how it affects me
- What I ponder
- What I believe

What I Feel
- Joy
- Anger
- Fear
- Sadness
- Shame

What I Say
- How I communicate with others
- Who I relate to (and who to avoid)
- How I express love and trust
- How I deal with conflict
- How I balance my needs with the needs of others

What I Do
- How I prioritize my time
- How I balance aspects of life (work, people, growth, fun) - focus
- How I learn and grow
