# Healthy Thinking for Well-being

This discussion is prompted by the book "7 Thoughts to Live Your Life By” by I.
C. Robledo.  This book taught me how to organize my thought life to be more
healthy and wise.  Learning how to guide my thoughts is one of the important
aspects of being more effect as a human.  Without developing this area I will
never reach my real potential.


## Key Questions

Thoughts 4 Me is a tool that helps you explicitly organize your thought life. 
It is organized around seven key questions.  For each question we will capture
positive and negative answers, which give us slightly differing insights on an
issue.

For example: "what can I control?" is matched with "what can I control?” to
produce a deeper level of thinking regarding control issues.

Focus on
Do not Focus on
What can I control?
What can I not control?
What is good?
What is bad?
What can I do?
What can I not do?
What do I have?
What do I not have?
What is the Present reality?
What is the Past or Future reality?
What do I need?
What do I want?
What can I give?
What can I take?

## Subtopics

Each question is also broken down into subtopics related to the key area of
thought.  The categories cause us to explore multiple ideas that we might not
readily think about.  These subtopics are built into a predefined template to
jump start your thinking but you are free to customize them to suit your
preferences.

Organize an entire outline of ideas related to answering each of the questions. 
This lets you fully develop and explore new ideas related to any topic. Thoughts
4 Me will organize and display your thinking which will reveal inconsistencies
and gaps.


## Organize Your Life

This system provides the most value when used over a long period of time.  The
first time you use it you will gather useful insights, but extended usage
reshapes your thinking. Our thoughts change with our moods so it is important to
visit the content with completely different mindsets.

This tool will give you a way to understand your decision process that may have
been previously hidden to you. Writing down how you feel and what you believe
can be extremely revealing.  Some thoughts look completely ridiculous when put
down in writing.


## Manage Your Thoughts

Many of us do a poor job at managing our thoughts.  We allow any old belief,
impression, feeling, or opinion to persist without challenge.  By honestly
evaluating these ideas we can eliminate the foolish ones and improve the great
ones. 

Flawed thinking is at the heart of much of our suffering.  Actively managing our
thoughts can produce a dramatic improvement in our well-being.  Clear thinking
is essential for having satisfaction in the life we are living.
