# My Mentor Tim

I am so grateful for the role Tim has played in my life.  As I have had time to
reflect on my spiritual journey, I recognize just how many times he has spoken
critical bits of wisdom to me, at a time when it was most needed.  

Other mentors played a key role in my development from an early
age.  But no one else has acted as a mentor and example in the way that
Tim has.  We first connected when I was about 40 and had many interactions
for the next 12 years.  Much of my thinking was shaped by advice that Tim
gave me.

Here are the truths that come to mind that he taught me.

- Find a balance between God's calling and the expectations of others.  Ministry 
is about serving another's vision while remaining true to what God is speaking to 
me personally.
- Life is about more that performance. Move from focus on DOING to BEING.
- Run the long race.  Don't burn up until the end of life.
- Success is not enough; we must find meaning and purpose and significance for 
fulfillment.
- Live a holistic life and invite God's Spirit into every area.
- Learn to tolerate the foolishness and immaturity of others.  Treat others with 
respect even when they don't deserve it.
- Emotions are a part of being human and can warn us of things that need 
attention.  How we feel is a critical part of our life with God.
- Prayer is simply being with God.  It does not really need words.
- Ministry is not meeting all the needs, but simply being available to however 
God desires to use me at each moment.
- Sometimes we are aligned with the church organization we are a part of and 
sometimes we need to stay connected even when not totally aligned.
- We need lifelong relationships and they are vital to make us thrive.

Each of these truths he modeled for me in a significant way.  While I had many
resources to draw on and many years to work out these truths I have had very few
role models.  I have had many teachers but few fathers in the faith.  

He took
time to listen to me and point out errors in my thinking.  I cannot think of
anyone that has had a greater impact on my spiritual development (except perhaps
Stacie). He has been my father, and taught me what it means to follow God
wherever he leads.

I am forever in his debt.  Thank you for all you have done.
