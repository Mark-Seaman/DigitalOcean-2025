# Timescape

Time is budgeted across several fundamental goals. Living a balanced life for me
means investing time in the areas reflect my values.

Meaning of Life

- Meaningful work - using my strengths to make a difference
- Deep relationships - characterized by trust and empathy
- Fun - rich daily experience of life
- Personal growth - becoming the person is want to be


Time Budget

Over the last eight years I have tracked how I spend my time.  I keep a simple
log of the day, time category, hours spent, and accomplishment.  A software tool
gathers all of this data and lets me see how I spent my time over the last day,
week, month, and year.

This has given me a tremendous amount of insight into what my ideal life looks
like.  While the time investment varies drastically over a week, it is
completely stable over the year.


Hours Per Week

I track time for 14 hours each day.  This gives me 10 hours off the clock.  Each
day I make notes of what I did yesterday and so far today.

14 hours/day translates into 98 hours per week.  This means that hours/week and
% of time are roughly equivalent.  This makes the arithmetic very simple.

Here is my ideal budget

- Work 40 hours
- People 30 hours
- Fun 20 hours
- Grow 10 hours


Accounting Categories

The main categories allow me to monitor the overall balance in my life.  As an
introvert people consume a great deal of emotional energy for me, whereas work
is effortless.  Without boundaries I could easily slide into 55, 15 between
Work, People.

The reverse is also true.  When I am engaged in demanding social activities my
People time may go to 50 hours in a week.  This is always reflected in a steep
decline in my overall sense of well-being.  This  is usually also reflected my
behavior, as I become a stressed out grouch.

The value of tracking my time is that it lets me see numerically what is
happening in my life.  This gives the opportunity to fine tune how I spend my
time to reflect what I truly value.
