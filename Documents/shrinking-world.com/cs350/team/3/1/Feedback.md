## Feedback for Engineering Team

* [Requirements](https://github.com/Esi-Mena/Instagram/tree/main/Documents/Milestone-1/Requirements) - **INCOMPLETE**
    * Project Charter is Good
    * Budget Feedback 
        * Estimate the total cost in hours 
        * Use past experience of similar projects (I estimate that you will spend 500 hours)
        * Engineering cost typically runs $60/h
        * This puts your project budget at about $30,000
        * Use this reasoning to include a budget for your project
        * Compare it with other projects
    * Include a Video with your Status Report
