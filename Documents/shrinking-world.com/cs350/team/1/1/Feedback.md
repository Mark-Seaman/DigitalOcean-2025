## Feedback for Engineering Team

* [Requirements](https://github.com/josh-flatt/cs350/tree/main/Documents/Milestone-1/Requirements) - **COMPLETE**
    * Excellent work - very complete and well documented.
    * Feedback on Budget
        * Don't use precise numbers because it implies precision.
        * I believe that your project will end up taking closer to 500 hr than the 200 hr you stated.
        * Engineers that you pay $30/hr will cost the client $60/hr to pay for the others costs.
        * Use a fully loaded cost for your engineering time. Eg. $60/hr
        * Bundle in the server cost since these are miniscule.
        * This puts your budget at $30k (500 h * $60/h)

* [Design](https://github.com/josh-flatt/cs350/tree/main/Documents/Milestone-1/Design) - **COMPLETE**
