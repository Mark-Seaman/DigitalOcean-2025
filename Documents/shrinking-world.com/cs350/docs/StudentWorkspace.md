# Student Project Workspace 


Welcome to CS350 at University of Northern Colorado.

This course teaches practical skills for software engineering.

This web server manages the software development process and is provided as a companion resource to the "[Software Engineering Course](https://shrinking-world.org/p/software-engineering-with-ai)" on "[shrinking-world.org](https://shrinking-world.org)".

When you purchase the "Software Engineering Course" a **Student Project Workspace** 
will be created for you.

- Regular price of "**Software Engineering Course**" is $140
- Use the discount code "**CS350**" to purchase for **$35** (or 75% off)
- Student Project Workspace is bundled into the course price

Work done by your **Application Project Team** will be built within this workspace.  
After you purchase the class you will login to your Workspace account with the 
**email** used when you registered and an initial password of "**CS350**".  (Note: It may take 24 hours for me to create the login on the workspace server)

Then follow the instructions to work on your team project.
