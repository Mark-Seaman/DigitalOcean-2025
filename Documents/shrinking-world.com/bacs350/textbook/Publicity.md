    A classroom-tested practical approach

    Learn by doing with 14 Projects & 42 Design Patterns


## About the Author

Mark Seaman has spent a lifetime learning how to produce high-quality 
software effectively. During his career he has worked in many different 
types of software development organizations and projects. Some of that 
knowledge has been encapsulated in this textbook so it can be directly 
applied to your next development project.

40 years of software development experience:
* HP – software developer - worked in the software lab designing Cameras, 
Scanners, PCs, Printers, All-in-Ones, OCR, and disc drives. Mentored and 
trained other developers on tools and technology. 
    * Holds 12 software patents, 22 patent applications, and 44 invention disclosures.
* Founder of Shrinking World Solutions - creating software services, web applications and training courses.
* Adjunct Professor at University of Northern Colorado - teaching web development and software engineering. 
* Author of "The Leverage Principle: A Software Architect's Guide to Optimizing Development and Operations”. 



## About the Book

"Building Python Web Apps" teaches a practical approach to web development.
The process outlined here combines the techniques used in commercial software
engineering with a systematic approach for the classroom.
* Overview
* Skills
* Demo Code
* Project

There is no other way to learn software other than by doing. This book is 
built around 14 application projects for you to complete. Each project 
guarantees that you have learned the skills you need to complete a project
in the real world.

Each chapter presents three new design patterns and then demonstrates how
they are combined to produce the desired result. These 42 Design Patterns
are presented in the context of a real-world application. The projects let
you practice the skills you have just learned.

Whether you are working for a major leading corporation, working as a freelance
consultant, or a student, these lessons are crafted to give you
what you need to know to level-up.

This book is paced to present a semester long upper-division university class.
It can easily be used as a textbook, with the projects evaluated by an 
instructor. This material has been taught and calibrated at University of
Northern Colorado.

The book can also be applied effectively for individual or team learning within a company. The
projects presented here can be easily swapped out for equivalent skills on your specific project of
interest.  Most web applications require about 50 tricks that are very common across all
applications. Your next web app will likely use almost all of the design patterns presented here.

Get ready to embark on the amazing journey of Building Python Web Apps!
