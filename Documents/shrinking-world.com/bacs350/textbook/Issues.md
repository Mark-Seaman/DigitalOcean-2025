# Project Issues

Every project has issues that require investigation and debate before making a decision.  This
list highlights the key issues that are being discussed for the "Web App in Python" Book.


## Titles & Terms

There are several titles that are discusssed in the [Titles & Terms](Titles.md) document.


## Format for Book Creation

We plan to use KindleCreator for the final book creation.  What is the easiest input
format to work with?  Stacie will make this decision and Mark will get the content in the
proper form.

* HTML
* Docx
* Epub


## Book Images

Each chapter has a photo to add a bit of style.  Little effort has gone into photo selection
I have gathered over 100 photos that may be suitable from "Pexels" and "Subsplash".
