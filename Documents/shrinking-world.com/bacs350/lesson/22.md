# Lesson 22 - CSV Files

## CSV Files

### Overview
* Chapter 11 in "Building Python Web Apps"
* Spreadsheet Data
* CSV Files
* Import/Export


### From Database to Spreadsheets
* Most data can be represented by one or more tables
* Spreadsheet data is everywhere
* Read records from file
* Write records to file
* Work out round trip for data


### Query Records for Table

    [[b.title, b.author, b.path] for b in Book.objects.all()]


Resulting Python list of lists

    [
        [
            1,
            "A Seaman's Journey",
            "Documents/journey",
        ],
        [
            2,
            "The Leverage Principle",
            "Documents/Principle",
        ]
    ]


### Print Table

    for row in table:
        print(row[0], row[1], row[2])


### Display Table

    '<table>
        {% for row in table %}
        <tr>
            {% for column in row %}
            <td>
                {{ column }}
            </td>
            {% endfor %}
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>'



### Exporting Data to CSV
Python defines a standard way to write CSV content to a file. 

    from csv import writer

    with open(path, 'w', newline='') as f:
        writer(f).writerows(table)

Resulting CSV File

    1,"A Seaman's Journey","Documents/journey"
    2,"The Leverage Principle","Documents/Principle"



### Importing Data from CSV
Python defines a reader that can parse the CSV data.  

Call the reader once to read a row from file

    from csv import reader

    with open(path) as f:
        return [row for row in reader(f)]



### Save and Restore Tables
* Export existing records to CSV file
* Import records from CSV file
* Test the round trip



## Project 11 - CSV

### CSV export and import
* Export the superhero records to a CSV file
* Import the superhero records from a CSV file
* Export the article records to a CSV file
* Import the article records from a CSV file
* Work until you can do a round trip


### Use Test-Driven Development
* Test adding two records
* Test query for all records
* Test serialization to CSV
* Test saving a file
* Test reading a file
* Test deserialization from CSV
* Test creation of existing objects
* Test complete round trip
