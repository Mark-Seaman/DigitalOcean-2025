# Lesson 27 - Software Engineering

## Software Engineering

### Review
* Images
* Application Design
* Automated Code Generation

### Overview
* Chapter 14 in "Building Python Web Apps"
* Agile software development
* Project Planning

### Design Patterns
* General solutions to common problems
* Standard implementation
* Encapsulation of design
* Document 
    * When to use it
    * Code implementation
    * Limitations
    * Customizations

### Software Lifecycle
* Requirements
* Design
* Code
* Test

### Waterfall Lifecycle
* Sequential phases
* Heavy on planning
* Deep commitment to the specification

### Agile Manifesto
* The world is volatile
* Development should be flexible
* Engage with customer weekly
* Plan with time horizon of one week 
* Parallel progress: Req., Design, Code, Test

### Incremental Development
* Test-driven development
* Complete each feature
* Use refactoring to evolve design

### Linear progress
* Same amount of progress every week
* "Crunch time" results from bad planning
* Customer sets the product backlog

### Milestones
* Milestones should be equally spaced
* Essential milestones can be expanded
    * Requirements Complete
    * Design Complete
    * Code Complete
    * Test Complete
* Everything is flexible throughout the project

### Proficiency
* Learning a new skill requires 10 times the effort
* Select familiar technology
* Budget for required learning

### Software Lifecycle
- Create Sample Milestones
- Goals by Milestone
- Adapting the Plans
- Test Everything

### Planning Grid
* Select 4-7 milestones for development stages
* Assign 4 roles: Requirements, Design, Code, Test
* Create a table of deliverables for each role and milestone
* Use to guide and measure development progress

### Essential Documents
- Produce needed documents only
- Everything under version control
- Client Communication website
    - Static Website Using Github Pages
    - Weekly progress (project show and tell)
    - Requirements
    - User Manual
