# Lesson 18 - Working with Data

## DevOps

### DevOps
* Development team
* Operations team
* Combine development and operations
* Automate your server config and testing
* Feedback loop


### Testing Servers
* Don't mess with the production server
* Build a test server identical to the production server
* Push testing to development as much as possible
* Keep similar server config


### Continuous Deployment
* Integrate your code frequently
* Run tests to ensure your system is working
* 50% of your code should be tests


### Single Script to Deploy
* Commit and push code
* Run tests
* Generate alerts for failures
* Deployment should never fail


### Regression Testing
* When you find a defect then write a test
* If bugs resurface your tests should catch them
* Your test and your product code are both assets



## Working with Data

### Production Database
* Create a database server to preserve data
* Hosting provider gives you tools


### Data Fixtures
* Data can be saved as a JSON file
* Data can be loaded from a JSON file
* Use data fixtures to set the state of the database


### Save Data From Database

    $ python manage.py dumpdata > database.json

    $ git commit -am 'Database objects'


### Load Data Into Database
On the new system pull in the old JSON file and import it

Beware that this will not work on a database with conflicting objects.

    $ python manage.py loaddata database.json


### Save the Database
Create five new hero records using the data views

Save Data From Database

    $ python manage.py dumpdata > database.json

    $ git commit -am 'Database objects'


### Load Data Into Production Database

On the new system pull in the old JSON file and import it

Beware that this will not work on a database with conflicting objects.


### App Spec - Run Command
At Digital Ocean create this new Run Command

Set scripts that run when you deploy your server

**app.yaml**

    services:
      run_command: |
        python manage.py migrate --no-input
        python manage.py loaddata database.json
        gunicorn --worker-tmp-dir /dev/shm config.wsgi


### Export Partial Data Set
Save Data From Database

    $ python manage.py dumpdata hero > hero.json

    $ python manage.py dumpdata hero --indent 4 > hero.json


### Import Partial Data Set
Save Data From Database

    $ python manage.py loaddata hero.json

Conflicting records will fail to load
