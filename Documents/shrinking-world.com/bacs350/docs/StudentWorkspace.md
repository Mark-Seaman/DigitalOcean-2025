# Student Project Workspace 


Welcome to **BACS350 at University of Northern Colorado**.

This course teaches intermediate web development by completing a series of projects.

This web server manages the software development process and is provided as a companion resource to the "**Python Web Apps**"  course on "**Shrinking-world.org**".

When you purchase the "**Python Web Apps**" course a Student Project Workspace will be created for you.

- Regular price of "**Python Web Apps**" is $140
- Use the discount code "**BACS350**" to purchase for **$35** (or 75% off)
- **Student Project Workspace** is bundled into the course price

Project work done by you will be built within this workspace.  After you purchase the class you will login to your Workspace account with the 
**email** used when you registered and an initial password of "**BACS350**".   (Note: It may take 24 hours for me to create the login on the workspace server)

Then follow the instructions to work on your team project.
