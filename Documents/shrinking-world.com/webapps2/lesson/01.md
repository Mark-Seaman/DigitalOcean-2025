* Server implement business rules 
    * talk to database

### App Platform Costs
* Free tier: build 3 static sites
* Basic tier: Django app w/database $12/month
* Scale as needs arise


### Django App Hosting
* Linux/Python
* Django runtime packages
* Database server
* Deployment scripts


### Static Web Server
