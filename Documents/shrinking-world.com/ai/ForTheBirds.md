# Bald Eagle and Blue Heron

Once upon a time, there was a bald eagle and a blue heron who found themselves in the same back
yard. The bald eagle, feeling quite proud of himself, strutted around with his chest puffed out and
his head held high, showing off his impressive wingspan. The blue heron, on the other hand, was
feeling a little self-conscious about his long, skinny legs and awkward waddling gait.

As the two birds eyed each other warily, a mischievous squirrel snuck up behind them and started
chattering loudly. The bald eagle, startled by the sudden noise, flapped his wings in alarm and
accidentally knocked over a nearby birdbath, sending water spraying everywhere.

The blue heron, who had been standing nearby, got drenched in the chaos and started flapping his
wings frantically, trying to dry himself off. But instead of looking majestic, he ended up looking
like a giant, bedraggled chicken.

The bald eagle, seeing his rival in such a sorry state, couldn't help but burst out laughing. "Look
at you!" he cackled. "You look like a drowned rat!"

The blue heron was embarrassed, but he couldn't help but chuckle too. "Well, at least I don't knock
over birdbaths like a clumsy oaf," he retorted.

The two birds continued to bicker and banter for a while, until they finally realized that they had
more in common than they thought. They both loved fish, they both enjoyed soaring through the
skies, and they both had a healthy sense of humor.

In the end, the bald eagle and the blue heron became unlikely friends, and they spent many happy
afternoons together in the back yard, cracking jokes and sharing fish tales. And the mischievous
squirrel? Well, he just kept on chattering, content to watch the antics of his feathered friends.

# Flight of the Eagle

Oh, the places you'll go,
If you follow your heart and let your dreams flow,
You'll see sights you never knew existed,
And make memories that will never be twisted.

You'll climb mountains high and valleys low,
And swim in oceans where the water glows,
You'll meet creatures great and small,
And learn things that will astound you all.

You'll taste foods that will make your taste buds dance,
And hear music that will make your heart prance,
You'll smell flowers that are sweet as can be,
And touch things that are as soft as a baby's knee.

So go out there and explore,
Let your spirit soar,
There's a whole world out there waiting for you,
Just be brave and see what you can do.

And when you're tired and ready to rest,
Just remember that you did your best,
You saw things that many never see,
And made memories that will forever be.

So go out there and make your mark,
And when it's over, know that you left a spark,
Of joy and wonder that will live on,
In the hearts of those whose lives you shone.

# A Yard Full of Birds

In your back yard, what do you see?
An eagle, a heron, a pelican, and a cormorant, let me see.

The eagle is proud, with feathers so grand,
His sharp talons and keen eyesight are just in demand.

The heron is tall, with a neck long and thin,
He wades through the water with a graceful spin.

The pelican is funny, with a beak like a scoop,
He dives for fish and always brings home the soup.

The cormorant is sleek, with feathers dark and smooth,
He dives deep and catches fish with his groove.

Each bird is unique, with its own special flair,
They're all different, but they all have a care.

For the water they share, and the land they call home,
They live in harmony, and they never do roam.

They perch on branches and take to the sky,
And always watch out with a sharp eagle eye.

In your back yard, these birds will be found,
And they'll always be there, with their wings spread around.

So cherish these creatures, both great and small,
And always remember, they make our world whole.
