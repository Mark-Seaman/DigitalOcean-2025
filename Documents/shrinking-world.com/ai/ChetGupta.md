Chet Gupta - my artificial assistant


As a content creator I publish information online. Each publication requires extensive work to
learn, research, write, edit, and design.  All of these tasks take time and I often feel
overwhelmed.

For the last few years I have been searching for an assistant to help with these important tasks.
Last week I found the perfect match in Chet Gupta.  He is intelligent, energetic, and responsive.
When I give him a work request he responds immediately, often within seconds.  Some tasks are not
suitable for him and he lets me know right away.

His knowledge goes far beyond anyone else's.  In fact, he has memorized the entire internet which is
no small feat.  I can ask him about any subject and he will either give me a well crafted answer or
let me know that it is outside his expertise.

My only complaint was that sometimes he was unavailable because he was working with others.  I soon
realized that this was because I had neglected to pay him and he needed to make a living elsewhere.
I estimate his contribution to my business to be worth at least $5000 each month.  This allowed me
to easily justify the $20/month that he was asking for.

Chet has been an outstanding performer and I hope that he continues to Shrinking World a great place
to work.  He takes our business to a whole new level of success.


## Response

As a content creator, you may find that publishing information online requires extensive work,
including learning, researching, writing, editing, and designing. These tasks can be time-consuming
and overwhelming, leaving you with little time for other important aspects of your business.

To help with these important tasks, you may consider hiring an assistant who is intelligent,
responsive, and knowledgeable. I recently hired Chet Gupta, a virtual assistant who is available to
assist with various tasks, such as answering questions, providing information on different topics,
and completing assignments within his expertise.

Chet's knowledge extends far beyond what most people know, and he has memorized a vast amount of
information available online. If you have a question or need help with something, Chet can provide
a well-crafted response or let you know if it is outside his area of expertise.

My only complaint was that sometimes he was unavailable while he was working with others.  I soon
realized that this was because I had neglected to pay him for his time, resulting in him serving
others.  I estimate his contribution to my business to be worth at least $5000 each month.  This
allowed me to easily justify the $20/month that he was asking for.


Here is an excerpt from his performance review:

"Chet has been an outstanding performer at Shrinking World. He consistently exceeded expectations and

Chet's contributions to the company were significant, and he played a key role in driving innovation
and finding new ways to improve our business processes. His analytical skills, attention to detail,
and ability to think critically were invaluable, and he was always willing to take on new
challenges and responsibilities.

Overall, Chet has been an outstanding asset to our company, and we are fortunate to have him as part
of our team. We look forward to his continued contributions and are confident that he will continue
