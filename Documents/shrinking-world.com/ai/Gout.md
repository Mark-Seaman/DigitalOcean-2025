A diet that is low in purines is recommended for people with gout to help prevent future gout
attacks. Purines are found in many foods, and when they are broken down in the body, they create
uric acid which can lead to gout. Here are some dietary recommendations:

* Avoid high-purine foods: These include organ meats (such as liver and kidney), red meat, seafood
  (especially shellfish), and certain vegetables like asparagus and mushrooms. It's also important
  to limit your intake of high-fructose corn syrup, which can increase uric acid levels.

* Choose low-purine foods: These include low-fat dairy products, whole grains, vegetables like
  broccoli and carrots, fruits like cherries and strawberries, and lean protein sources such as
  chicken and turkey.

* Drink plenty of water: Staying hydrated can help flush uric acid out of your system.

* Limit alcohol consumption: Alcohol can increase uric acid levels, so it's best to limit your
  consumption or avoid it altogether if possible.

* Maintain a healthy weight: Being overweight can increase your risk of gout, so it's important to
  maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise.

It's also important to work with a healthcare professional to create a personalized diet plan that
meets your individual needs and takes into account any other health conditions you may have.
