# Mastodon
by Mark Seaman


Oh, have you heard of Mastodons,<br>
Those great big beasts with massive brawn?<br>
They roamed the land so long ago,<br>
A sight to see, oh don't you know!<br>

With trunks so long and tusks so grand,<br>
They ruled the earth, a mighty band.<br>
Their shaggy fur and woolly hide,<br>
Could withstand the cold, no need to hide.<br>

They ate the leaves from high up trees,<br>
And used their trunks to blow and sneeze.<br>
Their footsteps shook the very ground,<br>
A thunderous noise, oh what a sound!<br>

But alas, the Mastodons are gone,<br>
No more to hear their ancient song.<br>
We'll remember them with awe and wonder,<br>
And honor their memory, never to sunder.<br>

So let us learn from Mastodons,<br>
And cherish life while we're here, everyone.<br>
For time goes by in the blink of an eye,<br>
And we too shall one day say goodbye.<br>

Pelican in flight,
Wings spread wide, gliding so free,
Graceful in the sky.

A fisherman's friend,
Pelican dives for the catch,
Feasting on the sea.

Sunrise on the beach,
Pelicans gather in flocks,
Greeting the new day.

Pelican takes flight,
Leaving footprints in the sand,
Echoes of the sea.

Raindrops on petals,
Nature's tears fall from above,
Beauty in sorrow.

Waves crash on the shore,
Seagulls cry out to the sea,
Eternal rhythm.

Cherry blossoms bloom,
Softly falling to the ground,
A fleeting beauty.

Night sky full of stars,
Constellations guide our way,
Mystery above.
