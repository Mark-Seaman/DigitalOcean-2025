## AI Response

The teaching progression you have outlined provides a helpful framework for building trust and
establishing a relationship with a student or learner. By gradually increasing the amount of time
and attention devoted to the learning process, you can help create an environment in which the
student feels comfortable and confident in their ability to learn and grow.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of each stage in the teaching progression:

    First contact (1 minute teaching): In the first contact, you have a very brief window to make a
    good impression and establish a connection with the student. This might involve introducing
    yourself, asking the student about their goals or interests, and setting expectations for the
    learning process.

    Interest (5 minutes): Once you've established a connection, it's important to build interest in
    the topic at hand. This might involve providing a brief overview of the subject matter, sharing
    examples or stories that illustrate its relevance, or asking the student to share their own
    experiences or opinions.

    Credibility (20 minutes): In order to build trust, you need to establish your own credibility as
    a teacher or expert in the subject matter. This might involve sharing your own background and
    qualifications, providing evidence or research to support your claims, or demonstrating your
    expertise through hands-on activities or exercises.

    Solve problems (60 minutes): Once you've established credibility, you can begin to focus on
    solving problems and helping the student build their skills and knowledge. This might involve
    working through specific examples or scenarios, providing feedback and guidance, and
    encouraging the student to ask questions and seek out additional resources as needed.

    Assistance (4 hours): As the student begins to develop their skills and knowledge, they may
    encounter challenges or roadblocks that require additional support and guidance. At this stage,
    it's important to be available to provide assistance and feedback, whether through one-on-one
    meetings, online support forums, or other means.

    Coaching (week): Finally, as the student becomes more advanced and self-sufficient, you can
    shift your focus to coaching and mentoring, providing ongoing support and guidance as they
    continue to grow and develop in their chosen field.

By following this teaching progression, you can help establish a strong foundation of trust and
expertise, while also providing the support and guidance necessary for learners to achieve their
goals and reach their full potential.
