I grew up building imaging software for Hewlett-Packard. Then I owned a software engineering company for over a decade. Now I teach web development and software engineering at the University of Northern Colorado. 

My key roles are teaching, writing, and programming.  I am passionate about the free and open use of technology to make the world better.

Software is everything and everything can be software.
