My Next Career

Since classes ended in December, at the University of Northern  Colorado, I have been planning the next phase of my life. I have been developing multiple career paths in software development, writing, and teaching for several years. Now is the time to begin to bring these together.

I have built a publishing platform for sharing information with others. I plan to publish articles daily for the foreseeable future. Eventually, this will include online classes to provide more depth. 

I would greatly value any feedback you have so I can make improvements. My theme for the coming year is to seek a deeper level of connection with others while consolidating the expended effort. I would love for you to be a part of my journey forward.
