The first hour is a precious time. I've been asleep but my mind has been churning, scheming, dreaming, and is teaming with ideas. As the sun rises I anticipate the past and recall the future that has not yet been written.  I write the words and concept of the night before they are lost forever.  Welcome the new day.
