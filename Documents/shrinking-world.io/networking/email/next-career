My Next Career

Since classes ended in December, at the University of Northern Colorado, I have been planning the next phase of my life. I have been developing multiple career paths in software development, writing, and teaching for several years.  Now is the time to begin to bring these together.

I have built a publishing platform for sharing information with others.  I plan to publish articles daily for the foreseeable future. Eventually, this will include online classes to provide more depth.  

I  would greatly value any feedback you have so I can make improvements.  My theme for the coming year is to seek a deeper level of connection with others while consolidating the expended effort.  I would love for you to be a part of my journey forward.
