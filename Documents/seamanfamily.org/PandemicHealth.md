# Pandemic Health Policy

## Need for a Health Policy

When the Pandemic started (March 11, 2020) we all thought we knew how to protect
ourselves from being infected.  But after just a few weeks it became obvious
that much of the information we were being given was highly filtered at
best and outright lies at worst.  Now we understand that the source of the 
confusion is tied to the breakdown in our society.

Several things became clear to me early on:

* Most of the info being circulated in incorrect and often dangerous.
* We must find trustworthy sources of information and act on there recommendations.
* We must each develop guidelines and our own personal policy.
* We must continue to operate in a society where most people are astoundingly
ignorant and prone to dangerous behaviors.
* We must track the numbers and change our behavior based on real risk.

The Pandemic reality has been constantly shifting and it is vital that we track
the current reality as it morphs.  This requires research, discussion, and a
willingness to learn and grow.  Without this we will end up making decisions
based on emotion rather than facts.


## Holistic Health

I needed to develop a rationale to help in making specific decisions related 
to health.  The dark times that we live in right now demand that we carefully
think through the key issues so that we can make intelligent decisions.

As I've been pondering this complex topic, it became clear that there are a
number of different threats that the pandemic brings.  Certainly the health
dangers are real and serious, but other factors could undermine our quality of 
life even though we remain disease free.

Holistic Health involves many dimensions that must be incorporated into our 
plans.

- Physical
- Relational
- Intellectual
- Emotional
- Financial
- Spiritual
- Vocational

Each of the challenges pose unique dangers to us so it is important to develop
policies and practices that find appropriate balance between Physical, Social, 
and Psychological concerns.  Each of these have a certain amount of conflict 
with each other.  Hence the high level of anxiety we all feel.


## Safety Spectrum

There is a natural tension between engagement and security.  We can never go
to either extreme an expect to live a full life.  In times of high threat we
naturally move to being more risk averse.  Our sense of risk is highly emotional
and it can be difficult to calibrate it to the actual reality.

Throughout the pandemic I have made a series of decisions to neglect many of
my life goals in favor of safety.  I have chosen to give up so much of what
I value in order to protect myself and others.

- Low Risk - Low Engagement 
- High Risk - High Engagement

This is a clear shift to protect physical health at the expense of psychological
well-being.  In my view this is an appropriate trade-off but cannot go on for
ever.  I long for a rich life that goes beyond simple survival.  I am trying to
make a conscious movement away from fear toward re-engagement. But this must
be done knowingly.


## Know Who to Trust

One of the things that is horribly wrong with our society is the amount of 
misinformation that is so rampant.  We must learn who the true experts are and
use the info they provide.

Fortunately we all have Stacie on our team.  She spends about an hour every day
reading and studying the morphing reality of COVID.  With her medical background
she is able to tell the lies from truth and is constantly learning and growing
in her understanding of the situation.

The numbers change weekly and old data (from last month) has little bearing on
dictating our behavior now.  I am so grateful to Stacie for sorting through all
the BS and proposing how we should stay safe.  We all benefit from her research.

Managing health is an area where most people have strong feelings.  Not only
do we have ideas about our own practices but we wish for all others to conform
to our way of thinking.  Early in the pandemic I felt a strong desire to 
influence others and make them see that my viewpoint was correct.

I have recently realized that I must have clear views on my own behavior but
must relinquish the need to change the behavior of others.  I have officially 
(and sometimes actually) let go of my need to influence the thinking of others.
I recognize that this is futile and often common ground is often lacking that
would allow us to all agree.

Where this is truly tested is when others make direct decisions that threaten
my health and safety.  In those cases I am very specific about what I will allow
and what is unacceptable to me.  I stop far short of demanding that others 
agree with me completely.  I do seek compliance on issues I view as critical for 
my safety.

I try to treat people with respect but will privately be disappointed when 
people seem to be unable to think critically and realistically.  I view this
as a major breakdown of our society as a whole and is well beyond the scope
of what I can address.



## My Personal Policy

I have carefully thought through key choices that need to be made and drafted
a way of making choices in this new uncertain world.   I recognize that everything
is a moving target so intend on continuously updating this to reflect the 
changing reality.  I want it in writing so that I can discuss it with others
and gain their insights.

- Hierarchy of needs (find balance)
    - Physical Safety - survival - 50% weight
    - Social goals - connect with others - 30% weight
    - Engagement - life goals - 20% - weight
- Decide on Desired Exposure
    - Everyone I talk with may be infected
    - Create my viralsphere community
    - Act with caution when operating outside the viralsphere
    - Eliminate marginal public appearances
    - Carefully evaluate prolonged exposure
- Wear a mask
    - N-95 mask for prolonged exposure (airplanes and close quarters)
    - Paper surgical mask for light duty safety
    - Cloth mask for compliance with no safety concerns
    - No mask when outside or alone
- Know the numbers
    - Understand transmission rates and mortality rates
    - Many more will die before the end
    - Find a new normal lifestyle adjusting for changing reality
- Vaccination
    - Get vaccinated as many times as allowed
    - Encourage other to get vaccinated
    - Celebrate the effectiveness of the vaccines
    - Tolerate the foolishness of anti-vaxers with grace


## Variants

The original virus has
mutated into multiple distinct variants.  The two most popular are Delta 
(August 2021) and Omicron (Oct 2021).  Each of these strains have different 
characteristics of transmission and lethality. So watching the numbers is 
important to understanding the precautions required.

* Contagion - how quickly the virus spread
* Hospitalizations - how many infected people become seriously ill
* Deaths - how likely is an infected person to die

With the Delta variant the disease became far more contagious.  Starting in late
summer through October the Delta virus ripped through the US. This created the
largest surge we had seen during the pandemic. It drove hospitals way beyond 
capacity.

With the Omicron variant the disease became far more contagious again.  Within
3 weeks it became the dominate version of the virus in the US.  Fortunately,
it is far less lethal than previous versions.


## Vaccination

I hope to remain uninfected, but the worst may happen.  This is where the good
news starts.  Those who are vaccinated are being infected (especially by Omicron).
But the serious health impact is greatly reduced with the vaccination.

Most people are experiencing only minor symptoms.  Many
are sick between 1-5 days (fever, cough). Those who have been boosted are even
more protected and only suffer typically from 1-2 days.  There are also reports
of people that have suffered from Long COVID that have recovered as a result
of the vaccine.

Like all probabilities, it is a numbers game.  Your mileage may vary.  But the
truth is the vaccines are exceeding all expectations.  Both for preventing
infection and mitigation of the infection.

I have personally known a lot of people who have been infected. Those without
the vaccine are in significant danger of long term complications.  Vaccinated
individuals do not suffer much risk of long term consequences. With the booster
the risk level from COVID is far lower that the flu.

With Omicron (which is as catchy as measles) everyone is likely to get infected.
The disease is everywhere right now and even vaccinated people are catching it.
I have know numerous vaccinated people that have caught Omicron.  The good news
is that they recovered quickly.


## If Infected

The CDC provides explicit guidance on the required level of quarantine and 
isolation.  I intend on following these rules if I were to get sick and will
insist on this will all of the people that I interact with.  If someone is not
following these rules then I will wear an N-95 mask around them or avoid them
entirely.

The quick takeaway from this doc is 

* Quarantine for 5 days
* Isolate for 5 days after fever breaks
* Don't travel until 10 days from the first symptoms
