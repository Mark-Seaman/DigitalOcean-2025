# Renewed Vows

## Erosion

What does it mean to renew the wedding vows?  As years go by all couples will
weather many storms, both minor and major.  The storms erode trust and passion.
Eventually the marriage may resemble the sandstone formations of Monument Valley,
where the underlying structure remains long after the outer layers are 
stripped clean of all life.

To counteract this devastation it is important to bring about a renewal of the
commitment that is the foundation of any relationship.  This starts with an
awareness of the forces that pull on us every day to rip us apart.  Very few
couples I know are consciously aware of the destruction that threatens their
happiness.


## Wedding

At every wedding the couple believes that they have found the right person who
will fulfill their personal desires.  We channel all of our hopes and dreams
into this moment and the wedding is built around lots of religious and romantic
imagery.

Wedding couples believe that the wedding is about them sharing their joy with
friends and family.  The married couples at the event know that there is something
deeper going on. There are commitments and promises being made that will soon
be put to the test.

Testing those promises occurs every day after the wedding.  Couples that are 
not aware of the selfishness that governs them will quickly succumb to its
influence.  Many marriages fail within the first year or two.


## Learning to Love

We all believe that love is natural and easy.  But it may be the most difficult
thing that we ever do.  Selfishness is the antithesis of love.  It is a love
killer.  It eats at us every day and threatens each of our relationships.

We learn to love when we choose to yield our own desires for the good of another.
Parent, child and spouse are the closest of all relationships and you can see
this powerful dynamic in every interaction.

Conquer/Submit, Win/Lose, Love/Hate, Me/Them, War/Peace. This is not easy. It
is hard. We must choose to love and then begin building habits of care for 
our spouse to counteract the natural process of decay.


## How Marriage Dies

A marriage does not die by a single act of betrayal.  That is simply the death
rattle, signaling the final moment when the spirit leaves the body.  Love dies
by 10,000 small acts of selfishness, usually occurring over many years.  A look -
an unkind word - hostile silence - withdrawal.

Some couples stay together long after their love has ended.  Perhaps they fear the
judgment of others over getting divorced.  Or they may realize that they need
each other and remain business partners even though they have no real 
emotional connection
left. I am surprised how many couples devolve into a transactional relationship,
where each person is required to perform tasks for the other.

Other couples see that they have no love left and seek to destroy each other.
Assigning blame allows them to feel faultless in their punishment of the other.
Much of the effort is channeled into rehearsing the wrongs suffered.


## The Vows

The vows that we take at our wedding are a reminder of what marriage is. It
is a lifelong bond of love that is so strong it can withstand all assaults.
When this bond is broken the marriage is dead, even if you keep living together.
The vows are a reminder of the high standard we aspire to.

We all stumble ... we are human.  In the same way that I have made vows to 
follow God's ways and yet fail, I fail to put my wife first over my desires.
Does this mean my marriage is dead?  Certainly not!  The vows serve to remind
me of the standard and the stakes.

We need these reminders to keep us investing in the things that are truly 
important.  We need reminders each day, week, month, year, and decade.  Each
of these should be appropriately sized to act as the reminder of the standard
and the stakes.  How often to have these events where you pause to think about
your marriage?


## Celebrate 25 Years

After 25 years of marriage, Stacie and I decided to host a big party and make
it similar to our wedding celebration.  At that event we rented a church,
bought a cake, invited our friends and family, told stories about the past, 
and watched a slide show of the first 25 years.

The highlight of the event was a renewal of the vows that we took at our 
wedding. For us this was a very meaningful event that said that we would do
it all over again.  Even with what we now know, we would choose to give our
lives without limitation to the greatest love we have ever known.

Here is a video that marks the renewal of our vows...
