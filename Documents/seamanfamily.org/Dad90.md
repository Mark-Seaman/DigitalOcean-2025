# Dad's 90th Birthday

In honor of my father on his 90th birthday, we threw a big party.

Words were said and things were done.

I read a couple of articles I wrote to celebrate the occasion.

I've posted them here for the enjoyment of anyone that missed the event.

## I've Become My Father
 
I don't know exactly when if happened.    But one day I looked in the mirror and
saw my dad looking back. This really shocked me!

As a child my mother used to say that I was a carbon-copy and something about an
acorn.  This was appalling to me since I am nothing like him.

As a young man I vowed that I would be completely different and held him up as
an example of what I did want to become. All his dysfunctions were on display
and acted as a cautionary tale of what I did not want for my life.

But at 50 I had a startling revelation.  The man in the mirror is my dad ... not
exactly but close enough for discomfort.

Let's review the checklist.

- Traveled throughout the world - check
- Fascinated by other cultures - check
- Lives in a world of ideas - check
- Writes books - check
- Teaches college - check
- Obsessed with completing the current project - check
- Constantly reading (over 1000 books read) - check
- Driven to achieve - unlimited ambition - check
- Chooses task over people - check
- Extremely opinionated with a high trust for his own judgement - check
- Be in control of everything - check
- Finds people generally foolish and irritating - check
- Proud of personal accomplishment - check
- Struggle to trust others - check
- Willing to reject those who offend - check
- Regularly top of the class - check
- Smartest guy in the room - check
- Struggles with aspects of autism - check
- Makes rules to manage everything in life - check
- Organized and clear thinking - check
- Articulate when presenting ideas - check
- Plans ahead for all contingencies - check
- Despises fanatics and extremists - check
- Never backs down from a fight when he knows he's right - check
- Boiling emotions beneath the surface, but fears expressing them - check
- Must be in charge - check
- Fearful of a dark future closing in - check
- Perfectionist - check
- Rather be respected and admired than adored - check
- Desire to be benevolent dictator - check
- Wants to make the world better -check


There are a lot of specific details in this list.   I have never met another person that is as much like me.

All of my best traits come from my father, as do all of my worst traits.

As I look in the mirror I accept it for what it is ... HERITAGE.    

Thank you, Dad, for making me who I am!
