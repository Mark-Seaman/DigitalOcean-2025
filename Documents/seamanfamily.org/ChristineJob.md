# Job Search Questions 

These questions were created by chatGPT to help guide the job search process. They cover a wide range of topics, from
personal motivations and career aspirations to financial considerations and negotiation strategies. Use these questions
to reflect on your goals, evaluate potential opportunities, and make informed decisions about your job search.

I wanted to avoid the awkwardness of asking these questions directly, so I'm sharing them here. It is easy to feel put
on the spot in any conversation of this type.  None of these questions are easy to answer and require some pondering
that is best done in private.

I hope they help you to clarify your thoughts and feelings about your job search.  I am here to help you in any way I can
but I don't want to be intrusive.  I am always available to talk about any of these questions or any other topic you want to
discuss.

Best of luck in your job search.  I know you will find something that is a good fit for you.
