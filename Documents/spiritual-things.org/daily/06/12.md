# Daily Meditation - June 12

## Scripture

Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to sinful desires. Do
not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve  sin.

Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but  now you have
new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do  what is right for the
glory of God. 

Sin  is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the
requirements  of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God's grace.

Romans 6:12


## Prayer

God, you are my constant source of strength. Without you I am lost. Fill my
mind with the truth and guide me on the path that leads to your will being
done in me as it is in heaven.  Let your freedom come!
