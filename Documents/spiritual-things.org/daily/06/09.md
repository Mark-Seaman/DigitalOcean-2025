# Daily Meditation - June 9

## Scripture

Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life
as he was. We  know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so
that sin  might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin. For
when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin. 

And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him. We  are sure
of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will  never die again.
Death no longer has any power over him. When he died, he died once to break the
power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God. 

So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive
to God through Christ Jesus.

Romans 6:5


## Prayer

I look forward to the time when my struggle with sin is at an end. Your kingdom
has already come but is not yet fully realized.  Help me to walk today in the
dynamic of this future reality.
