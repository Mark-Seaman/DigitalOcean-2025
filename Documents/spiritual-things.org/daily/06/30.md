## Scripture

The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one
Lord, and his name the only name.

## Prayer

Let your kingdom come so that your will be performed everywhere. I long to see
this world in alignment with your purposes and plans.  Make me an instrument
of your grace everywhere I go.
