# Daily Meditation - June 17

## Scripture

They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. For 
ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky.  Through
everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible  qualities â€” his eternal
power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God. Yes, 
they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him  thanks.

And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like.  As a result,
their minds became dark and confused. Claiming to be wise, they instead
became utter fools. And  instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God,
they worshiped idols.

Romans 1:19


## Prayer

Thanks for revealing yourself to all of us.  Help me to accept your truth and
walk in that.  We are created to worship and if we do not worship you we will
find something else to worship.  When we seek after idols our minds become 
dark and confused.
