# Daily Meditation - June 29

## Scripture

God's  law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as
people sinned more and more, God's wonderful grace became more  abundant. So
just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God's
wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and
resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Romans 5:20


## Prayer

There is no limit to how far you will pursue us with your love.  Even though
we run from you, you are still the relentless lover.  Redemption is in your
character.
