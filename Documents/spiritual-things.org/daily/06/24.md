# Daily Meditation - June 24

## Scripture

No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you
will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be
enslaved to money.

That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life â€” whether you have
enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than food, and
your body more than clothing?  

Look at the birds. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your
heavenly Father feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to him than they
are?  Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?

Matthew 6:24


## Prayer

I so often get distracted by the cares of survival.  My own worries about the
future steal away the joy of living a life of purpose and contentment.  Life
is so much more that just survival or getting my own way.  Show me what you
are inviting me into.
