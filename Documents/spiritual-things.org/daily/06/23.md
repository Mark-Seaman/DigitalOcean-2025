# Daily Meditation - June 23

## Scripture

Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust
destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in
heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and
steal. Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also
be.

Matthew 6:19


## Prayer

What I value most holds my heart.  Change my heart, O God.  Make it ever true.
Change my heart and make me like you.
