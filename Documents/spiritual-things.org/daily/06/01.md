# Daily Meditation - June 1

## Scripture

Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys
them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in heaven,
where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.
Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.

No  one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other;  you
will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and be
enslaved to money.

Mat 6:19


## Prayer

Lord, I desire to pursue you above all other aspects of my life.  I am so easily
distracted by so many things that take me off the path toward you.  I confess
that I am often drawn to selfishness and meeting my own ego needs.  Give me
a pure heart to follow you.  Let me see others as you see them.
