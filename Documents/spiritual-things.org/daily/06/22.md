# Daily Meditation - June 22

## Scripture

When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he instructed his disciples to cross to
the other side of the lake.

Then one of the teachers of religious law said to him, "Teacher, I will
follow you wherever you go.”

But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens to live in, and birds have nests, but the
Son of Man has no place even to lay his head.”

Matthew 8:18


## Prayer

You came to this world to live life as a man.  And you did not come as a king
but you came in poverty into an impoverished society to live with a conquered
people and die as a criminal.  

This is so hard for me to even wrap my head around.  I will never understand
it but I will always treasure how this happened.
