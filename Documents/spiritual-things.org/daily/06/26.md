# Daily Meditation - June 26

## Scripture

We  are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this
is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are. For everyone has
sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard. Yet  God, in his
grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this  through Christ Jesus
when he freed us from the penalty for our sins. For  God presented Jesus
as the sacrifice for sin. 

People are made right  with God when they believe
that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his  blood. This sacrifice shows
that God was being fair when he held back  and did not punish those who
sinned in times past, for  he was looking ahead and including them in what
he would do in this  present time. 

God did this to demonstrate his
righteousness, for he  himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right
in his sight when  they believe in Jesus.

Romans 3:22


## Prayer

To be human is to be in rebellion against your will.  You have sacrificed
your life so that I can be reconciled to you.  I desire to experience the 
fullness of your kingdom (your rulership and authority). Bring your redemption
to every area of of life.
