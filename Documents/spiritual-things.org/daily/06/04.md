# Daily Meditation - June 4

## Scripture

And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they
grow. They don't work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was
not dressed as beautifully as they are. 

And  if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and  thrown
into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do  you have so
little faith?

So don't worry about these things, saying, 'What will we eat? What will we
drink? What will we wear?' These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers,
but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs. Seek the Kingdom of
God[e] above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you
need.

So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's
trouble is enough for today.

Mat 6:28


## Prayer

Lord, I thank you for how you care for all of my needs.  Help me to trust 
completely in your provision.  Your love is enough to get me through this life.
Show me how to rely on you more fully.
