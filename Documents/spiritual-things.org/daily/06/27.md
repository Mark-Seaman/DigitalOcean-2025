# Daily Meditation - June 27

## Scripture

Therefore, since we have been made right in God's sight by faith, we have
peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us. Because
of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved  privilege
where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look  forward to sharing
God's glory.

Romans 5:2


## Prayer

Thank you for the amazing peace that you have brought into my life.  Your
grace have brought me the undeserved privilege that changes everything. It is
what makes me confident and joyful as I look forward to sharing God's glory.
