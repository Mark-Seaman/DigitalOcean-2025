# Daily Meditation - June 6

## Scripture

Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who
builds a house on solid rock. 

Though  the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat 
against that house, it won't collapse because it is built on bedrock. 

But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't obey it is foolish, like a person
who builds a house on sand. When the rains and floods come and the winds beat
against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash.

When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his
teaching, for he taught with real authorityâ€”quite unlike their teachers of
religious law.

Mat 7:24


## Prayer

It is easy to know the truth and yet ignore it.  Don't just let me have a
familiarity with what is true, but a passion to pursue it.  Give me a bold
heart and a tenacity to follow you where ever you might lead me.
