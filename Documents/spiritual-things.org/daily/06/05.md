# Daily Meditation - June 5

## Scripture

That  is why I tell you not to worry about everyday lifeâ€”whether you have 
enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than  food,
and your body more than clothing? 

Look  at the birds. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for 
your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to him  than
they are? Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?

So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's
trouble is enough for today.

Mat 6:25

## Prayer

Food, shelter, work, community, and health are the most basic needs.  You provide
everything that is needed.  Allow me to be content with what you have given
and live generously for others. Help me to simplify my life so that I can be
more effective in your kingdom.
