## Scripture

Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us
later. For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will
reveal who his children really are. Against its will, all creation was subjected
to God's curse. But with eager hope, the creation looks forward to the day when
it will join God's children in glorious freedom from death and decay. 

For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth
right up to the present time. And  we believers also groan, even though we
have the Holy Spirit within us  as a foretaste of future glory, for we long for
our bodies to be  released from sin and suffering. We, too, wait with eager hope
for the  day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children,
including the new bodies he has promised us. 

We were given this hope when we
were saved. If we already have something, we don't need to hope for it. 
But if we look forward to something we don't yet have, we must wait patiently
and confidently.

Romans 8:18


## Prayer

Sometimes this life becomes so heavy and the burdens become great.  In that 
space we cry out to you for a fresh foretaste of the life that is to come.
One without sorrow or pain.
