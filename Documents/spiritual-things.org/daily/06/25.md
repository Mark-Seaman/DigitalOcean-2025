# Daily Meditation - June 19

## Scripture

When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for
us sinners. Now,  most people would not be willing to die for an upright
person, though  someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is
especially  good. 

But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we
were still sinners. And since we have been made right in God's sight by the
blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God's condemnation. 

For since
our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son  while we were
still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the  life of his Son. 

So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our
Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God.

Romans 5:6


## Prayer

It astounds me that you would seek to redeem us even as we continue to rebel
against you. I rejoice in the relationship that you have invited us into.
You have converted your enemies to friends.  Thank you so much.
