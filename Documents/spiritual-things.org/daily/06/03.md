# Daily Meditation - June 3

## Scripture

Your eye is like a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is
healthy, your whole body is filled with light. But  when your eye is unhealthy,
your whole body is filled with darkness.  And if the light you think you have is
actually darkness, how deep that  darkness is!

Mat 6:22


## Prayer

My world view governs everything in my life.  How I see determines what I do,
say, think, and feel.  Give me the ability to see the world and my life as
you see them.  Bring your light into every area of my life.
