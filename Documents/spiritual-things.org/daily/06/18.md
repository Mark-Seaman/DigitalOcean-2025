# Daily Meditation - June 18

## Scripture

Since  they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their
foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done. Their 
lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy,  murder,
quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. 

They  are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They 
invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. 

They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no
mercy. They  know God's justice requires that those who do these things deserve
to  die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do  them,
too.

Romans 1:28


## Prayer

When we abandon our life with you we fall into every kind of darkness.  Your
presence brings light.  Release us from the shackles of our own making
as well as the effects of living in this world so corrupted by rebelling
against your authority.  Let us experience your kingdom today.
