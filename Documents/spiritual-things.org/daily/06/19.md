# Daily Meditation - June 19

## Scripture

We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that
they help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character,
and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And  this hope
will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God  loves us,
because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts  with his love.

Romans 5:3


## Prayer

I never like having my character tested.  Help me to see the benefits of the
problems in my life.  Give me a heart that discerns what you are doing in me.
Allow me to partner with the growth that you are cultivating through your 
presence in me.
