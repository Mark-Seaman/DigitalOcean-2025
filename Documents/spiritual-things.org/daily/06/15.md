# Daily Meditation - June 15

## Scripture

I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless
because of what Christ has done. Yes,  everything else is worthless when
compared with the infinite value of  knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake
I have discarded everything  else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could
gain Christ and  become one with him. 

I no longer count on my own righteousness
through  obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ.
For God's way of making us right with himself depends on faith. 

I  want to know
Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him  from the dead. I want to
suffer with him, sharing in his death, so that one way or another I will
experience the resurrection from the dead!

Philippians 3:7


## Prayer

There are a great many things that I have treasured in my life above your 
presence.  But when I am totally honest, I see that they are nothing compared
with your infinite value.  

My accomplishments and my righteousness are trash when compared to your glory.
I want to experience you in every dimension in my life. Transform me from the
inside out!
