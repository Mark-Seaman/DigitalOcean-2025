# Daily Meditation - June 21

## Scripture

When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned.
But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of
their faith in God who forgives sinners. 

Clearly, God's promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants
was based not on his obedience to God's law, but on a right relationship with
God that comes by faith. If God's promise is only for those who obey the law,
then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless.  

Abraham was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever
he promises. And because of his faith, God counted him as righteous.

Romans 4:4


## Prayer

You don't own anyone a debt.  We can never be good enough to earn your blessing.
You lavish you undeserved favor on us so that we can find peace and joy.
I am so grateful for all you have done in my life.  Thank you.
