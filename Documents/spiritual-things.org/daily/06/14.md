# Daily Meditation - June 14

## Scripture

And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love. Neither
death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our
worries about tomorrow — not even the powers of hell can separate us from God's
love. 

No  power in the sky above or in the earth below — indeed, nothing in all 
creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is  revealed
in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Romans 8:38


## Prayer

There is no power in the universe that is greater than you.  Yet, I often lose
sight of that reality.  When I am frightened and anxious, remind me of your
goodness and allow me to celebrate all that you have done for me.
