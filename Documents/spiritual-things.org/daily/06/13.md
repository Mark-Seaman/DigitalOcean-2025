# Daily Meditation - June 13

## Scripture

Those  who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but 
those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that  please the
Spirit. So  letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. 

But 
letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace. For the sinful
nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God's laws, and it never
will. That's why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature
can never please God.

Romans 8:5


## Prayer

My mind is often darkened by thinking that is completely contrary to your will.
Thoughts of self-interest, superiority and inferiority, revenge and domination
can take over and squeeze out your goodness.

Help me to feast on the need for your presence and express gratitude for all
that you have done for me.  This is the only way out of the trap of living for
my self.  Let your kingdom come to my mind and emotions.
