# Daily Meditation - June 8

## Scripture

God's  law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as 
people sinned more and more, God's wonderful grace became more  abundant. So 
just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God's 
wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting
in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Ro 5:20


## Prayer

Your redemption is so amazing - eternal life for those who don't deserve it.
This is the very definition of grace.  I stand in awe of your goodness.
