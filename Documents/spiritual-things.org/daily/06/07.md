# Daily Meditation - June 7

## Scripture

When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for
us sinners. Now,  most people would not be willing to die for an upright person,
though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially 
good. But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while
we were still sinners. 

And since we have been made right in God's sight by the
blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God's condemnation. For since
our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son  while we were
still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the  life of his Son. So
now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord
Jesus Christ has made us friends of God.

Ro 5:6


## Prayer

It boggles my mind that you would care so much for me even when I am running
from you.  Thank you for you tremendous love.  Help me to be fully conscious 
of what it costs you as I live out my life.
