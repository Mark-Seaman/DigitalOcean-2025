# Daily Meditation - June 10

## Scripture

But  you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the 
Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you.  And Christ lives within
you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you
life because you have been made right with God. 

The
Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just  as God
raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your  mortal bodies by
this same Spirit living within you.

Romans 8:9


## Prayer

Thank you that your Spirit lives within me.  You are constantly reminding me
of what is true and how I should act and think. You bring your life to me in
all areas.
