# Daily Meditation - June 20

## Scripture

Well  then, should we conclude that we church people are better than others? No,
not  at all, for we have already shown that all people, whether religious or
not, are under the power of sin.  

As the Scriptures say, "No one is righteous — not even one. No one is truly
wise; no one is seeking God. All have turned away; all have become useless. No
one does good, not a single one. They rush to commit murder.  Destruction and
misery always follow them. They don't know where to find peace. They have no
fear of God at all.”

Romans 3:9


## Prayer

I have to admit that I would not be able to follow you at all except for your
constant presence in my life beckoning me forward.  It is easy for me to believe
that my good deeds result from my own inner goodness.  But if I am honest it
is all about you!  Thank you for not leaving me alone to wither.
