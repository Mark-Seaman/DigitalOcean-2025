# Daily Meditation - July 1

## Scripture

What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires
that battle within you? You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet
but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have
because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask
with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.

James 4:1


## Prayer

Lord, forgive me for my greed and pride, that would seek to put my own
interests above everyone else.  This is frequently demonstrated by 
the conflict that flares up around me.  Teach me to hold all things
losely in my life while I pursue your will with passion.
