# Daily Meditation - July 27

## Scripture

Jesus had loved his disciples during  his ministry on earth, and now he loved them to the very end.
So he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist, and poured
water into a basin. Then he began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel he had
around him.

After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, "Do you understand
what I was doing? You call me "Teacher" and "Lord", and you are right, because that's what I am.
And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other's feet.
I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you. 

I  tell you the truth, slaves are not greater than their master. Nor is  the messenger more
important than the one who sends the message. Now that you know these things, God will bless you
for doing them.

John 13:4


## Prayer

In your teaching and demonstration you showed us that you expect we would love each other.  This
love is passionate and sacrificial and entirely unreasonable.  Teach me how to love in this way
so that I can be more like you.  This is all so contrary to my human nature that seeks to dominate
rather than serve.
