# Daily Meditation - July 7

## Scripture

"I have the right to do anything,” you say — but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to
 do anything” — but not everything is constructive. No one should seek their own good, but the good
 of others.

Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience, for, "The earth is the
Lord's, and everything in it.”

So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. Do not cause anyone
to stumble — even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but
the good of many, so that they may be saved.


1 Corinthians 10:23


## Prayer


It is not about my freedom only, but also the responsibility that I have to care for others.  it is so easy for me to judge and criticize others and their weakness.  But your love compels me to be
loved by compassion and legitimate concern for others.  Teach me how to love like you love.
