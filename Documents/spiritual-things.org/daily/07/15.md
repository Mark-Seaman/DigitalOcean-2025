# Daily Meditation - July 15

## Scripture

In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out
everything in conformity with the purpose of his will, in order that we, who were the first to put
our hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory. 

And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your
salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is
a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession.

Ephesians 1:11


## Prayer

We were created to bring praise and glory to you.
The good news of salvation brings us to you initially and keeps bringing us back to your 
presence.  This is indeed a glorious privilege.
