# Daily Meditation - July 2

## Scripture

Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of
his wonderful grace? Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we
continue to live in it? Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with
Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death? For  we died and were
buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was  raised from the dead
by the glorious power of the Father, now we also  may live new lives.

Romans 6:2


## Prayer

Lord, I dedicate my life afresh to your plans.  I deeply desire to do your 
will even though I often get side-tracked by trying to get my own way.
"Your will not mine" - my heartfelt prayer.
