# Daily Meditation - July 12

## Scripture

Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms
with every spiritual blessing in Christ. For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to
be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus
Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will â€”  to the praise of his glorious grace, which he
has freely given us in the One he loves. 

Ephesians 1:3


## Prayer

You have selected and invited us into an extraordinary journey of transformation from death to life.
Help me to live true to this glorious calling.  Show me how I can walk as an adopted child of 
the ruler of the entire universe.  Thank you for inviting me into your family.
