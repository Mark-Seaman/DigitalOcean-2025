# Daily Meditation - July 11

## Scripture

And  the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don't know  what God wants us to pray
for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with  groanings that cannot be expressed in words. And the
Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers
in harmony with God's own will. And we know that God causes everything to work together for
the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. 

Romans 8:26

## Prayer

Sometimes the pain can't be expressed in words.  Thank you for understanding this expression even
when poorly articulated.  You are always at work, weaving everything that happens into a complete
plan according to your will.  This is especially comforting when I don't understand the path of my
life.
