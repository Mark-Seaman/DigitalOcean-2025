# Daily Meditation - July 29

## Scripture

I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what
Christ has done. Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as
garbage, so that I could gain Christ and become one with him.

Philippians 3:7


## Prayer

There is nothing that will bring fulfillment like knowing you.  I want to understand your truth
and live it out daily.  Becoming one with you is the reason that I am alive today.  Nothing else
can compete with the joy of experiencing your Spirit.
