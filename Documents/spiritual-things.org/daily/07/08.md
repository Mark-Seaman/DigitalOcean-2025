# Daily Meditation - July 8

## Scripture

If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience. But  if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do  not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake  of conscience. 

I am referring to the other person's conscience, not yours. For why is my freedom being judged by
another's conscience?  So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of
God. Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God — even as I try to
please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many.


1 Corinthians 10:27


## Prayer

Conscience is a tricky thing.  Help me to respect the journey that others are on.  Make me sensitive
to the needs and challenges that others face.  Give me a spirit of gentleness and kindness toward
others.  Let me deny the judgemental spirit that so easily asserts itself.  Give me grace as I
interact with those whose lives have been so different than mine.
