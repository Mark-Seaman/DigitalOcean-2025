# Daily Meditation - July 28

## Scripture

For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God. So  you have not
received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead,  you received God's
Spirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him, "Abba, Father.‚Äù

For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God's children. And 
since we are his children, we are his heirs. In fact, together with  Christ we
are heirs of God's glory. But if we are to share his glory, we  must also share
his suffering.

Romans 8:14


## Prayer

Thank you for the mystery of adoption into your family.  We no longer have to
live as slaves to fear. Your Spirit constantly reaffirms this reality even 
though our minds cannot comprehend "How?" or "Why?".
