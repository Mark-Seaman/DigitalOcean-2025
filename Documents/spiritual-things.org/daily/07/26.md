# Daily Meditation - July 26

## Scripture

Always be full of joy in the Lord.  Let everyone see that you are
considerate in all you do. Remember, the Lord is coming soon.

Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him
for all he has done.  Then  you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can
understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in  Christ Jesus.

Philippians 4:4


## Prayer

Help me to live in your peace.  Many cares threaten from every side.  It is so easy to give into the
fear. Teach me to begin and end each day in celebration of your goodness.  Then fill my mind with
gratitude during the time in between.
