# Daily Meditation - July 30

## Scripture

For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn[n] among many brothers and sisters. And  having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called  them, he gave them right standing with himself. And having given them  right standing, he gave them his glory.

Romans 8:29


## Prayer

What a beautiful thing it is to be selected and hand picked by your love.  I acknowledge that you
have pursued me relentlessly my whole life.  You have adopted me into your family and redeemed
me in every way.  I have been truly saved by your grace.
