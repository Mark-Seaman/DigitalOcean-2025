# Daily Meditation - July 21

## Scripture

He is the Maker of heaven and earth,
the sea, and everything in them â€”
he remains faithful forever.

He upholds the cause of the oppressed
and gives food to the hungry.

The Lord sets prisoners free,
the Lord gives sight to the blind.

The Lord lifts up those who are bowed down,
the Lord loves the righteous.

The Lord watches over the foreigner
and sustains the fatherless and the widow,
but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.

Psalm 146:6


## Prayer

Justice is a part of your character.  You defend the weak and expect us to do the same.
Your care for humanity is beyond my understanding.  I am so grateful that you are always
at work in our lives.
