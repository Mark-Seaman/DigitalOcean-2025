# Daily Meditation - July 31

## Scripture

You have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury: "An eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth."  But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the
right cheek, offer the other cheek also.  If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from
you, give your coat, too.  If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile, carry it
two miles.  Give to those who ask, and don't turn away from those who want to borrow.

Matthew 5:38


## Prayer

I confess my desire to fight back when others attack me.  Show me how to act with love toward 
people who cause me pain. Give me a forgiving heart, and remind me of how much I have been 
forgiven.
