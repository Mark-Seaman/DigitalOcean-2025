# Daily Meditation - July 25

## Scripture

Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled
by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit. So letting your sinful nature
control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace.

Romans 8:5


## Prayer

Let your Spirit dominate my thinking.  Let me linger on your thoughts.  Help me to turn from things
that result in death and become alive in you.  I long to experience the fullness of your kingdom
in my life.
