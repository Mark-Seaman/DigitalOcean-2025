# Daily Meditation - July 10

## Scripture

When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right. And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom. 

But  now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God.  Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal  life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.

Romans 6:20


## Prayer

I no longer am enslaved to sin, but now I have a choice.  So often I still choose selfishness as I 
seek out my will over your way.  Help me to follow the path that leads to life rather than the 
path that leads to death.  I choose freedom over slavery.
