# Daily Meditation - July 16

## Scripture

As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you
followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now
at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the
cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature
deserving of wrath. 

Ephesians 2:1


## Prayer

There is a ruler of this world who is opposed to your plan to rule in my life.  If I listen to the 
false ruler of this world then I will be led down a path of self-gratification that ends in death.
Show me the path of life and how to walk there.
