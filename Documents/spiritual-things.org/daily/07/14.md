# Daily Meditation - July 14

## Scripture

For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with
are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.

We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and
we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. 

2 Corinthians 10:3


## Prayer

Taking control of our thoughts and feelings is extremely difficult.
Yet the battle is won or lost in our mind.  Building a thought life based on your truth is
the foundation of our life with you.  Help me to fully embrace your truth and recognize when
I am beginning to drift.
