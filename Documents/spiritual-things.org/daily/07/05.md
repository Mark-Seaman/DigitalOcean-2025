# Daily Meditation - July 5

## Scripture

For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ. 

Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did. 

1 Corinthians 10:10


## Prayer

Lord, I am aware that my journey with you is for a lifetime. Following you is not
a temporary commitment that produces benefits before moving on.
It is a transformation that must
continue and deepen over the years. 
The path of life is littered with the corpses of those you have started
well and had good intentions.  But eventually they lost their way and left the
path to follow their own agenda.
