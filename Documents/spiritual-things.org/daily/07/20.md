# Daily Meditation - July 20

## Scripture

Praise the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary;    praise him in his mighty heavens. Praise him for
his acts of power;    praise him for his surpassing greatness. Praise him with the sounding of the
trumpet,    praise him with the harp and lyre, praise him with timbrel and dancing,    praise him
with the strings and pipe, praise him with the clash of cymbals,    praise him with resounding
cymbals.  Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

Psalm 150


## Prayer

There are many ways to celebrate your presence.  You do so many amazing things that we are
not even aware of.  Help me to be more frequent and passionate in celebration.
