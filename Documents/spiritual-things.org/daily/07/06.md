# Daily Meditation - July 6

## Scripture

Our ancestors were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea. 
Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.

These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the culmination of the ages has come. So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! 

No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.

1 Corinthians 10:11


## Prayer

It is so easy to start well yet fall along the way.  There are so many
temptations and distractions that compete for my attention and affection.  Give
me a single minded focus to pursue you above all else.
