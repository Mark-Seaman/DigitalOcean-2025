## Scripture

For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith — and this is not from yourselves, it is the
gift of God —  not by works, so that no one can boast.  For we are God's handiwork, created in
Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.

Ephesians 2:8


## Prayer

Your grace has been at work long before I knew you.  There is nothing that I can do to make you
love me any more or less.  Nothing can ever repay all that you have done for me.  Yet you do have
tasks that you have designed specially for me to do. Teach me to be faithful in the thing that
you ask of me.  As your handiwork, let me do your handiwork on this earth.
