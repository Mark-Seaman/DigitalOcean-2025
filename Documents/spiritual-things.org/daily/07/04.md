# Daily Meditation - July 4

## Scripture

If God is for us, who
can ever be against us? Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him
up for us all, won't he also give us everything else? 

Who  then will condemn us? No one â€” for Christ Jesus
died for us and was  raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of
honor at God's  right hand, pleading for us.

Can  anything ever separate us from Christ's love? Does it mean he no longer
loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry,  or
destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death?  No, despite all these
things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.


Romans 8:31


## Prayer

Thank you for the tremendous freedom that you have bought for me.  While I once
was driven by guilt and fear, I can now live life fully.  My new identify as your
child changes every aspect of what it means to live the life that you desire for
me.  This would never be possible apart from the work that you have done.
