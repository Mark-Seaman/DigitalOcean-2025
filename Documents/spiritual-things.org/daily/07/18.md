# Daily Meditation - July 18

## Scripture

I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit
of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better. I pray that the eyes of your
heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches
of his glorious inheritance in his holy people, and his incomparably great power for us who
believe.

Ephesians 1:17
 

## Prayer

I pray that I may know you more completely in every way: Son, Father, Spirit.  Reveal your hope, 
glorious inheritance, and power to me.  Show me the treasures that you have hidden within your 
people for me to discover.
