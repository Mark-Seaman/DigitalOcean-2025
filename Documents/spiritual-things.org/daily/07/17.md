# Daily Meditation - July 17

## Scripture

The sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants
with demons. You  cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot  have a
part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons. 

So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God. Do not cause
anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God â€” even as I try to please everyone
in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.

1 Corinthians 10:20


## Prayer

Worshiping any other thing is idolatry and leads to serving demonic spirits.  We can't have it 
both ways.  Show me the areas where idolatry can steal away my life in you.  Help me to do all
things to your glory.
