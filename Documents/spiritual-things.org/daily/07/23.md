# Daily Meditation - July 23

## Scripture

For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God's
people, I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.  

That power is the same as the mighty strength he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and
seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms, far above all rule and authority, power and
dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.

And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the
church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.

Ephesians 1:15


## Prayer

As I bumble through life it is good to know that there are people that are praying for me. You have
provided me with many on my journey who can remind me of your goodness when I forget.  Your power
and glory are beyond anything we could ever comprehend.  Show me a greater glimpse of how your
kingdom influences my daily life.  Let your grace come to me in both sorrow and joy.
