# Daily Meditation - July 24

## Scripture

Remain  in me, and I will remain in you. For a branch cannot produce fruit if  it is severed from
the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you  remain in me. Yes,  I am the vine; you are the
branches. 

Those who remain in me, and I in  them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do
nothing.  If you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it
will be granted! When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples.

John 15:4


## Prayer

I am constantly tempted to go off on my own, pursuing my agenda in my own power.  And then
in the end, I am frustrated that I don't produce fruit.  Your kingdom is much better than mine
teach me to walk simply, honestly, and humbly with with each day.  Make me fruitful in your ways.
