# Daily Meditation - July 22

## Scripture

The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures,he leads me beside
quiet waters,     he refreshes my soul.He guides me along the right paths    for his name's sake.
Even though I walk    through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil,    for you are with me; your
rod and your staff,    they comfort me. You prepare a table before me    in the presence of my
enemies. You anoint my head with oil;    my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will
follow me    all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord    forever.

Psalm 23


## Prayer

In every waking moment and when I sleep, you are there... leading, guiding, protecting, teaching,
and nurturing me.  You correct me when I leave your path and celebrate when I return.  I would
have no life apart from you.

You walk with me in both the light and the dark.  Your presence is a constant comfort in my 
sorrow.
