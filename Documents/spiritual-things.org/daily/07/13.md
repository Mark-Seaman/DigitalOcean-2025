# Daily Meditation - July 13

## Scripture

In Christ we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the
riches of God's grace that he lavished on us. With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to
us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put
into effect when the times reach their fulfillment â€” to bring unity to all things in heaven and on
earth under Christ.

Ephesians 1:7



## Prayer

You have a plan for redemption.  It is so wonderful that you have made me a part of your purpose
to save humanity.  Thank you for your intense passion and constant work to bring your kingdom 
order to us even when we choose anarchy and a lifestyle that amplifies suffering.
