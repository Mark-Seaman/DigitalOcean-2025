# Daily Meditation - September 13

## Scripture

You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother's womb.
Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex! Your workmanship is marvelous â€” how well I know
it. You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the
dark of the womb. You saw me before I was born.  Every day of my life was recorded in your
book. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed.

Psalm 139:13


## Prayer

There are many parts of my psyche and physiology that I can not understand.  Humans are so complex
and yet you know every part of our makeup.  I have been created to live a life that only you 
understand.  Teach me my purpose so that I may live true to it.
