# Daily Meditation - September 7

## Scripture

Pray like this:

Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon.May your will be done
on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us today the food we need, and forgive us our sins, as
we have forgiven those who sin against us. And don't let us yield to temptation, but rescue
us from the evil one.

When you pray, don't babble on and on as the unbelievers do. They think their  prayers are answered
merely by repeating their words again and again. 

Matthew 6:7


## Prayer

Prayer is an invitation to understand your purpose for my life.  During prayer, I receive 
encouragement and nourishment.  Sometimes prayer is just words and lacks any true 
connection at all. Or worse yet, prayer can border on witchcraft as I attempt to manipulate you
into doing my will.  The essence of all prayer is an acknowledgment that you are God and I am not.
Teach me to pray as Jesus prays.
