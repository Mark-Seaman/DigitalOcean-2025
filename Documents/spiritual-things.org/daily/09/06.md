# Daily Meditation - September 6

## Scripture

In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He existed in the beginning with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created
except through him.

The Word gave life to everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone.

The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.

John 1:1


## Prayer

In my thinking, I often try to imagine a version of you that is so small and limited. The model is
based on human nature with some supernatural capabilities thrown in. I can not even comprehend your
true nature that creates the entire universe from nothing.  My mind boggles when I try to embrace
your infinite nature that knows no bounds.  I simply worship what I can never truly understand.
