# Daily Meditation - September 28

## Scripture

Listen to me, dear brothers and sisters. Hasn't God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in
faith? Aren't they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him? But you
dishonor the poor! Isn't it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? Aren't they the ones
who slander Jesus Christ, whose noble name you bear?

James 2:5


## Prayer

How I treat others demonstrates my devotion to God's purpose for my life. When I favor the rich
and powerful over the poor and weak I am in rebellion against his rulership. The motivations
of self-interest are a contraction to God's kingdom.  This often shows itself when I consider the
people that I wish to associate with.
