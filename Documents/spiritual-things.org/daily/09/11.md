# Daily Meditation - September 11

## Scripture

O Lord, you have examined my heart and know everything about me. You know when I sit down or stand
up. You know my thoughts even when I'm far away.

You see me when I travel and when I rest at home. You know everything I do. You know what I am going
to say even before I say it, Lord. You go before me and follow me.  You place your hand of
blessing on my head. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too great for me to understand! 

Psalm 139:1


## Prayer

Nothing is hidden from you. I often do not understand myself, yet you know me perfectly.  Only you
can unlock the mystery of why I do what I do and feel what I feel.  It is such a comfort that with
this perfect knowledge you still love me as I am.
