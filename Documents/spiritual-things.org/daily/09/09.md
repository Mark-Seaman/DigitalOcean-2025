## Scripture

Yes indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures: "Love your neighbor
as yourself.” But if you favor some people over others, you are committing a sin. You are guilty of
breaking the law. 

For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of
God's laws. For the same God who said, "You must not commit adultery,” also said, "You must not
murder.” So if you murder someone but do not commit adultery, you have still broken the law. 

So whatever you say or whatever you do, remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you
free. There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if  you have been
merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you.

James 2:8


## Prayer

I don't really like to see myself as a law breaker, but I must confess that every day some of my
actions hurt others and me.  No matter which offenses I create it makes me guilty.  I need to
repent and receive forgiveness as a regular activity.  It is like taking a shower daily to be
washed clean.  Make me aware of these things and free me from their bondage.
