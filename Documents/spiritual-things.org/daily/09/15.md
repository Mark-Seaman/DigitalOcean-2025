# Daily Meditation - September 15

## Scripture

All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual
blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ. Even before he made the
world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes. 

Ephesians 1:3


## Prayer

You loved and nourished me as a member of your family, even before I existed.  Your amazing love is
so much greater than I can ever comprehend.  Thank you for all that you do in me.  Show me how to
live up to this fantastic privilege that you granted.
