# Daily Meditation - September 14

## Scripture

How precious are your thoughts about me, O God. They cannot be numbered! I can't even count them;
they outnumber the grains of sand! And when I wake up, you are still with me! 

Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. Point
out anything in me that offends you, and lead me along the path of everlasting life.

Psalm 139:17


## Prayer

You understand me in a way that I don't.  Though I often deceive myself I can never deceive you.
You know the truth about every aspect of my life.  Teach me to walk in full obedience to your
will and live the destiny that you have mapped out for me.
