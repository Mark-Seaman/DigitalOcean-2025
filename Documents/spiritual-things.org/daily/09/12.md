# Daily Meditation - September 12

## Scripture

I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God's power for us who believe
him. This is the same mighty power that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place
of honor at God's right hand in the heavenly realms.

Now he is far above any ruler or authority
or power or leader or anything else â€” not only in this world but also in the world to come.  God
has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things, who
fills all things everywhere with himself.

Ephesians 1:19


## Prayer

Thank you for the power that you provide to me so that I can live life according to your will. 
I welcome you as King to lead me and guide me.  Your authority is the only one that truly matters.
What an amazing thing it is to be a part of your family.
