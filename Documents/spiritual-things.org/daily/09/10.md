# Daily Meditation - September 10

## Scripture

You have heard that our ancestors were told, "You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are
subject to judgment." But I say, if you are even angry with someone, you are subject to judgment!
If you call someone an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse
someone, you are in danger of the fires of hell.

So if you are presenting a sacrifice at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember
that someone has something against you, leave your sacrifice there at the altar. Go and be
reconciled to that person. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God.

When you are on the way
to court with your adversary, settle your differences quickly. Otherwise, your accuser may hand
you over to the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
And if that happens, you surely won't be free again until you have paid the last penny.

Matthew 5:21


## Prayer

You take reconciliation very seriously.  You set a high bar when it comes to attacking others and 
seeking revenge. Make me aware of the unresolved conflicts in my life and the courage to reconcile
and forgive.
