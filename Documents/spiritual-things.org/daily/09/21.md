## Scripture

Watch out! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward
from your Father in heaven. When  you give to someone in need, don't do as the hypocrites
do â€” blowing  trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts  of charity! 

I tell you the truth, they have received all the reward they  will ever get. But when you give to
someone in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Give your gifts in
private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.

Matthew 6:2


## Prayer

Acts of piety that are done to be seen by others are not righteous at all.  Any motivation that 
serves our egos is an attempt to build our own kingdom, which is hostile your authority in our lives.
Indeed, when I act to be admired by others it is a sin (open rebellion against your will). Show
me when I do this and help me to repent.
