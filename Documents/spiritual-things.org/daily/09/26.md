# Daily Meditation - September 26

## Scripture

For the same God who said,  "You must not commit adultery,” also said, "You must not murder.” So if
you murder someone but do not commit adultery, you have still broken the law. So whatever you say
or whatever you do, remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you free.  There will be
no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if you have been merciful, God will be
merciful when he judges you.

James 2:11


## Prayer

Lord, help me to abound in generosity toward others. I desire to follow you in every area but often
do not do it very well.  Teach me to walk humbly and with sensitivity to your Spirit. Just because
I avoid certain sins does not mean that I am righteous.
