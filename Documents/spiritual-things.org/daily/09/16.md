# Daily Meditation - September 16

## Scripture

You have heard the commandment that says, 'You must not commit adultery.' But I say, anyone who even
looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. So if your eye
causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. 

And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one
part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

Matthew 5:27


## Prayer

You have a much higher standard for our conduct than we have for ourselves.  You see the corrupting
effects of sin and how it steals our lives away.  Please teach me to see the effects of my rebellion
against your will as as the serious issue it truly is.
