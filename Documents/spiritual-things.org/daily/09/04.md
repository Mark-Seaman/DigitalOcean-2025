# Daily Meditation - September 4

## Scripture

Believers who are poor have something to boast about, for God has honored them.  And those who are
rich should boast that God has humbled them. They will fade away like a little flower in the field.
The  hot sun rises and the grass withers; the little flower droops and  falls, and its beauty
fades away. In the same way, the rich will fade  away with all of their achievements.

James 1:9


## Prayer

In this world the poor are despised and the powerful are elevated.  The rich are able to abuse the
impoverished without consequence. But you have a different economy in your kingdom, where the
balance is leveled.  You lift up the poor and take down the rich. 

We see your kingdom partly here now, but understand that it will be fully upon us all soon.  No
matter what happens in the lives of others I realize that forty years from now I will experience
the glory of a world that operates completely in this new reality.  The poor will no longer be
victimized by the wealthy.  Your will shall be done on earth as it is today in heaven only.
