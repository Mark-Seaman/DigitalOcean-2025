# Daily Meditation - September 2

## Scripture

Don't worry about these things, saying, "What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?"
These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your
needs. 

So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's trouble is enough
for today.

Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you
need.

Matthew 6:31


## Prayer

Your care is so abundant and so consistent for me.  Forgive me for not fully trusting you.  I so 
often get worked up over what might go wrong in the future that I forget to acknowledge what you
have done for me in the past and present time.  Thank you for your deep concern for my needs.
