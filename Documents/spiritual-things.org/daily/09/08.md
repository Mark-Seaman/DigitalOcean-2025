# Daily Meditation - September 8

## Scripture

God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward they will receive the
crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. 

James 1:12


## Prayer

I acknowledge that testing, temptation, and hardship are a natural part of life.  I can't become the
person that you need me to be without these experiences shaping me.  I yield to your perfect work
and know that the process of transformation is not always easy.
