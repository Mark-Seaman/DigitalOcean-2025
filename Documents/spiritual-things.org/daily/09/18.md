# Daily Meditation - September 18

## Scripture

I can never escape from your Spirit! I can never get away from your presence! 

If I go up to heaven, you are there; if I go down to the grave, you are there. If I ride the wings
of the morning, if I dwell by the farthest oceans, even there your hand will guide me, and your
strength will support me.

I could ask the darkness to hide me and the light around me to become night - but even in darkness I
cannot hide from you. To you the night shines as bright as day. Darkness and light are the same to
you. 

Psalm 139:7


## Prayer

You know me completely and there is nowhere for me to run.  You know my innermost thoughts and
how these translate into the actions that I take.  My entire life and being is completely 
transparent to you even though it is often opaque to me.
