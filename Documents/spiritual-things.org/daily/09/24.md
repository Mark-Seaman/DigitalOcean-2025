## Scripture

Yes indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures: "Love your neighbor
as yourself.‚Äù  But if you favor some people over others, you are committing a sin. You are guilty
of breaking the law. For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a  person
who has broken all of God's laws.  

James 2:8


## Prayer

Help me to treat all people with love and respect. I acknowledge that there is an extreme prejudice
in my heart for certain kinds of people.  Reveal this to me when it surfaces, and set me free
from this corruption in my soul.
