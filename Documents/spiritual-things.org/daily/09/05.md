# Daily Meditation - September 5

## Scripture

God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of
evil things against you because you are my followers.  Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a
great reward awaits you in heaven.  And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same
way.

Matthew 5:11


## Prayer

There is a fundamental resistance to hearing the truth.  Humans have a violent reaction to being
challenged to change what they believe.  People would rather stay in darkness and will go to any
lengths to justify their thinking.

Unfortunately, I see this resistance in my heart too.
Help me to be teachable and receptive to learn and grow and change.  Help me to be kind and
grateful to those who would challenge my worldview.
