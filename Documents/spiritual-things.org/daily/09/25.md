# Daily Meditation - September 25

## Scripture

All these people died still believing what God had  promised them. They did not receive what was
promised, but they saw it  all from a distance and welcomed it. 

They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth. Obviously people who say such things
are looking forward to a country they can call their own.  

If  they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone  back.  But they were
looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland.  That is why God is not ashamed to be called their
God, for he has  prepared a city for them.

Heb 11:13


## Prayer

I am so impatient when it comes to getting what I want.  I tend to lose hope so quickly.  Forgive
me for my lack of trust. You are always at work in my life to reveal your plan and purpose in me.
Thank you for the grace you bring.
