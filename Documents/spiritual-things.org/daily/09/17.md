# Daily Meditation - September 17

## Scripture

God has now revealed to us his mysterious will regarding Christ - which is to fulfill his own good
plan. And  this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together  under the
authority of Christ - everything in heaven and on earth. Furthermore, because we are united with
Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for he chose us in advance, and he makes
everything work out according to his plan.

Ephesians 1:9


## Prayer

This is the good news of your kingdom.  It is indeed mysterious! You will bring everything together
under your authority.  Both heaven and earth will be completely submitted to your leadership. By 
submitting our lives now we will have an inheritance within your kingdom. We will be reconciled
through the sacrifice that you made for us.  Thank you for your love for all of us humans.
