# Daily Meditation - September 20

## Scripture

Ever since I first heard of your strong faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for God's people
everywhere, I have not stopped thanking God for you. I pray for you constantly,  asking
God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual wisdom and insight so
that you might grow in your knowledge of God.  I  pray that your hearts will be flooded with
light so that you can  understand the confident hope he has given to those he called - his holy
people who are his rich and glorious inheritance.

Ephesians 1:15


## Prayer

Prayer changes us at the deepest level. We see others through the viewpoint that you have for them.
We desire for your kingdom to take hold and flourish in every person that we pray for.  This
remarkable transformation makes us ready to be used in their lives for how your Spirit will 
lead us.
