# Daily Meditation - September 3

## Scripture

God  has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be  wisdom itself. Christ
made us right with God; he made us pure and holy,  and he freed us from sin.  Therefore, as the
Scriptures say, "If you want to boast, boast only about the Lord.‚Äù

1 Corinthians 1:30


## Prayer

I am so concerned with my own accomplishments and ego needs that I naturally direct the focus to me.
But everything true and good has come from you.  I should be bragging about you grace, provision,
rescue and security that is a result of your kindness. Forgive me for the blindness of
self-absorption.
