# Daily Meditation - September 19

## Scripture

When  you pray, don't babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their  prayers are answered
merely by repeating their words again and again. Don't be like them, for your Father knows
exactly what you need even before you ask him! 

If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you. But if you
refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.

Matthew 6:7


## Prayer

It is so easy to treat pray as a ritual or magic recipe to get what we want.  But true prayer
must start we an deep humility, understanding that we are not God and that we often at conflict
with your will. 

Prayer that starts in this way ends with us being enveloped by your endless love.  Remove all
religious pretensions and expectations that can manipulate you into giving me what I want.  Help
me submit without reservation to be engulfed by you presence.
