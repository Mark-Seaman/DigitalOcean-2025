# Daily Meditation - September 23

## Scripture

God's purpose was that we Jews who were the first to trust in Christ would bring praise and glory
to God. And  now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God  saves you. And
when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he
promised long ago. The  Spirit is God's guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he
promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this  so we would praise and
glorify him.

Ephesians 1:12

## Prayer

It is truly a miracle that we are invited into your family.  Trusting is Christ is the only real
requirement to being reconciled to you.  Learning to live in your kingdom is about receiving 
your authority and accepting your will.  Believing in Christ  goes far beyond simple intellectual
acknowledgement of the truth.  It requires that we be aligned with the motivation to know you in
the way that Jesus demonstrated while on earth.  This enables a rich inheritance that is 
available to all the citizens of your kingdom.
