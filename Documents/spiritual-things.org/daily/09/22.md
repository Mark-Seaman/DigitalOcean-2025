# Daily Meditation - September 22

## Scripture

Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance about
things we cannot see. Through their faith, the people in days of old earned a good reputation. By
faith we  understand that the entire universe was formed at God's command, that  what we now see
did not come from anything that can be seen. 

And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to  come to him must believe that
God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him. 

Heb 11:1


## Prayer

The essence of faith is a simple trust in your goodness and care for me.  I desire to know you
better and to trust you more.  Through many ups and downs I need to know that you are there working
out your will in my life. Help me to completely trust in your goodness.
