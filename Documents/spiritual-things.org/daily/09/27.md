# Daily Meditation - September 27

## Scripture

God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus
Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. So we praise God for the
glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son. He is so rich in kindness
and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins. He has
showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.

Ephesians 1:5


## Prayer

There are so many amazing things that you have done for us.  You adopted us into your family,
purchased our freedom, and forgave our sin.  You brought so much kindness and understanding to us.
I can never fully realize all that you have done.
