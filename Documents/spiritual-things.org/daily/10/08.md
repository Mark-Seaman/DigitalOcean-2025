# Daily Meditation - October 8

## Scripture

How can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favor some people over
others?
  
For example, suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and expensive
jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in dirty clothes.  

If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, "You
can stand over there, or else sit on the floor” — well,  doesn't this discrimination show that your
judgments are guided by evil motives?

James 2:1


## Prayer

I confess that I judge people by what I think they can do for me.  Forgive me for my hard heart.
Teach me to love all people for who they are, the way that you love them.
