# Daily Meditation - October 28

## Scripture

Trust in the Lord with all your heart;  do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in
all you do, and he will show you which path to take.  Don't be impressed with your own wisdom.

Instead, fear the Lord and turn away from evil. Then you will have healing for your body and
strength for your bones. 

Proverbs 3:5

## Prayer

I am constantly tempted to trust in my own understanding and be very impressed with my own wisdom.
Your wisdom is what is needed to keep me out of harm's way.  True healing and wholeness are only 
found in following the path that you set out.
