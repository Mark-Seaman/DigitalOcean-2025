# Daily Meditation - October 12

## Scripture

He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when our Lord
Jesus Christ returns.  God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited
you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

1 Corinthians 1:8

## Prayer

It is your work in my life that makes the difference.  My attempt of self-improvement never result
in the outcome that I wish for.  Teach me to trust in you with everything that is in me.  I know
that you will see me through to the finish line.
