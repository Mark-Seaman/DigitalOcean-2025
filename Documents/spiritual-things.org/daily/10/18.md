# Daily Meditation - October 18

## Scripture

Those who are trying to force you to be circumcised want to look good to others. They don't want to
be persecuted for teaching that the cross of Christ alone can save.  And even those who advocate
circumcision don't keep the whole law themselves. They only want you to be circumcised so they can
boast about it and claim you as their disciples. 

Galatians 6:12


## Prayer

It is interesting to see how quickly our passion for obedience turns into legalism.  This is then
the basis for our feeling of self-righteousness that lead us to judge and criticize others.
Forgive us for our arrogance and reveal this cancerous attitude before it metastasizes.
