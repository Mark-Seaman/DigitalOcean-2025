# Daily Meditation - October 26

## Scripture

At that same time Jesus was filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit, and he said, "O  Father, Lord
of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things  from those who think themselves wise and
clever, and for revealing them  to the childlike. Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way.

"My  Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son  except the Father, and
no one truly knows the Father except the Son and  those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” 

Then when they were alone, he turned to the disciples and said, "Blessed are the eyes that see what
you have seen.  I  tell you, many prophets and kings longed to see what you see, but they  didn't
see it. And they longed to hear what you hear, but they didn't  hear it.” 

Luke 10:21


## Prayer

Thank you for all that you have revealed.  You have demonstrated what true life is like and how to 
live effectively.  You have brought us into a relationship of intimacy that we don't deserve.
You have revealed the mysteries of the universe to your followers.
