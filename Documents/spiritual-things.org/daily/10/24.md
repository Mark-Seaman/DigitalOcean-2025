# Daily Meditation - October 24

## Scripture

If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard work, and then give
generously to others in need. Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good
and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.

And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as
his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption.

Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil
behavior. Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through
Christ has forgiven you.

Ephesians 4:28


## Prayer

There are many ways that we try to hide our sin from others.  But there is no hiding it from you.
Reveal in me those things that cause you sorrow and give me the courage to acknowledge my brokenness.
Transform my life and bring me your healing and wholeness.
