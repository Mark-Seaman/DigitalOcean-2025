# Daily Meditation - October 10

## Scripture

And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.  God chose things despised
by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world
considers important.  As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.

God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself.

1 Corinthians 1:27


## Prayer

There are many things that we think are wise, but are just plain foolish.  True wisdom comes from you
alone.  It may be delivered to us through a variety of paths but its true source is your truth.
Show me your truth and help me to embrace it fully and completely.
