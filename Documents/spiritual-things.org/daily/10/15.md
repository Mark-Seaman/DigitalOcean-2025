# Daily Meditation - October 15

## Scripture

Remember that few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful or wealthy when God called you.
Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are
wise. 

1 Corinthians 1:26


## Prayer

You economy is nothing like that of this world.  What I value is so often the opposite of what you
do.  Teach me to see all things through your eyes and to love what you love.
