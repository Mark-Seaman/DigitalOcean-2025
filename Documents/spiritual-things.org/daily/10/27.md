# Daily Meditation - October 27

## Scripture

What is causing the quarrels and fights among you? Don't they come from the evil desires at war
within you? 

You want what you don't have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of
what others have, but you can't get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. 

Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it.  And even when you ask, you don't
get it because your motives are all wrong â€” you want only what will give you pleasure.

James 4:1


## Prayer

So much of our pain and turmoil is of our own making.  To be human is to be greedy and selfish.
Forgive our rebellion against you and redeem our lives.  Give us the ability to see what you want
to do in others through us and the courage to humbly follow your lead.
