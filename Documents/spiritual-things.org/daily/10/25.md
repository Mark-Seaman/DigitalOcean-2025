# Daily Meditation - October 25

## Scripture

For the Lord grants wisdom! From his mouth come knowledge and understanding. He grants a treasure of
common sense to the honest. He is a shield to those who walk with integrity. He guards the paths of
the just and protects those who are faithful to him.

Proverbs 2:6


## Prayer

Let you wisdom guide me each day.  Let your understanding be my shield.  Guard me with a coat of
faithfulness that lets me bypass opportunities for evil.
