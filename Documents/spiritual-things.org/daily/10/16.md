# Daily Meditation - October 16

## Scripture

Those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit.  So let's not get
tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don't
give up.  Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone â€” especially to
those in the family of faith.

Galatians 6:8


## Prayer

Teach me to persevere through all situations and focus on the goal of life in you. Show me how to
avoid compassion fatigue and to live sustainably.  I desire to be a source of good and your 
blessing in this world.
