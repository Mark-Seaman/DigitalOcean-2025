# Daily Meditation - October 29

## Scripture

A Jewish man was traveling from Jerusalem down to Jericho, and he was attacked by bandits. They
stripped him of his clothes, beat him up, and left him half dead beside the road.

By chance a priest came along. But when he saw the man lying there, he crossed to the other side
of the road and passed him by. A Temple assistant walked over and looked at him lying there,
but he also passed by on the other side.

Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the man, he felt compassion for him. Going
over to him, the Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he
put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him. 35 The next day
he handed the innkeeper two silver coins, telling him, "Take care of this man. If his bill runs
higher than this, I'll pay you the next time I'm here."

Now which of these three would you say was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by bandits?

Luke 10:30


## Prayer

There are many excuses that I offer to explain why I do not care about those around me. But none
of these impress you or justify my inaction.  Show me where you are working and give me the courage
to participate obediently.
