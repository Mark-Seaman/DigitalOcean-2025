# Daily Meditation - October 9

## Scripture

Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won't need to compare yourself to anyone else.  For we are each responsible for our own conduct.

Galatians 6:4


## Prayer

I often am unwilling to control my own action, relationships, thoughts, and feelings.  Instead, I
focus on trying to control others. I use judgment and criticism to justify myself.

Teach me to be responsible for myself and accept others as they are without needing to control them.
