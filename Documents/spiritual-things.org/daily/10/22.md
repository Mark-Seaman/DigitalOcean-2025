# Daily Meditation - October 22

## Scripture

The Lord now chose seventy-two other disciples and sent them ahead in pairs to all the towns
and places he planned to visit. 

Now go, and remember that I am sending you out as lambs among wolves. Don't take any money with you,
nor a traveler's bag, nor an extra pair of sandals. And don't stop to greet anyone on the road. 

Whenever you enter someone's home, first say, "May God's peace be on this house." If those who live
there are peaceful, the blessing will stand; if they are not, the blessing will return to you. 

Luke 10:2


## Prayer

We are called to go where you send us. Where ever we are we must see what you are doing.  You are
always at work but many choose to remain in darkness.  We are to extend your blessing to those who
are receptive and separate from those who are not.
