# Daily Meditation - October 11

## Scripture

It doesn't matter whether we have been circumcised or not. What counts is whether we have been
transformed into a new creation.  May God's peace and mercy be upon all who live by this principle;
they are the new people of God.

May I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross,
my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world's interest in me has also died.  

Galatians 6:14


## Prayer

It is not keeping rules that make me close to you.  The process of transformation is what really 
matters.  Peace of mercy are available to all who are being transformed and renewed by your Spirit.

There is no reason to boast because the whole journey of transformation is simply a response to 
your love.  Help me to live in this reality.
