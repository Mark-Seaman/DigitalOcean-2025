# Daily Meditation - October 30

## Scripture

We know that the law is good when used correctly. For  the law was not intended for people who do
what is right. It is for  people who are lawless and rebellious, who are ungodly and sinful, who
consider nothing sacred and defile what is holy, who commit murders, or are sexually immoral, or
are slave traders, liars, promise breakers, or who do anything else that contradicts the wholesome
teaching that comes from the glorious Good News.

1 Timothy 1:8


## Prayer

There are many ways to sin, but only one way to walk in purity.  Obedience and loyalty to your
will in the only possible path to life.  Teach me to stay on the narrow path and use the examples
in scripture to show me what that looks like.
