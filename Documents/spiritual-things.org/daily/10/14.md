# Daily Meditation - October 14

## Scripture

May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.  I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now that you belong to Christ Jesus.  

1 Corinthians 1:3


## Prayer

Grace and peace are two things that I long for.  Thank you for your abundant gifts in my life. You
have transformed me from the inside out.  And your constant presence will continue to grow me up
into the person you have destined for me to be.
