# Daily Meditation - October 20

## Scripture

Jesus and the disciples came to a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her
home.  Her sister, Mary, sat at the Lord's feet, listening to what he taught.  But  Martha was
distracted by the big dinner she was preparing. 

She came to  Jesus and said, "Lord, doesn't it seem unfair to you that my sister just sits here
while I do all the work? Tell her to come and help me.”

But the Lord said to her, "My dear Martha, you are worried and upset over all these details! There
is only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it, and it will not be taken
away from her.”

Luke 10:38


## Prayer

I view activity as the main focus in my life.  But this causes me to miss the truly important 
things.  Listening to you and learning your ways is so essential to the transformation that must 
take place.  Teach me to value this as you do.
