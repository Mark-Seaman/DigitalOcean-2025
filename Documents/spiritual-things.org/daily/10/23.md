# Daily Meditation - October 23

## Scripture

Don't envy violent people or copy their ways. Such wicked people are detestable to the Lord,    
but he offers his friendship to the godly.

The Lord curses the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the upright.
The Lord mocks the mockers but is gracious to the humble.

Proverbs 3:31


## Prayer

Arrogance and violence are characteristics of those who are not following you.  There will come a
time when your judgment will come upon them.
