# Daily Meditation - October 17

## Scripture

Through him, God has enriched your church in every way â€” with all of your eloquent words and all of
your knowledge.  This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true.  Now you have every
spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ.  

1 Corinthians 1:5


## Prayer

You have given me all of the resources to live the exact life that you intend for me to live.
Help me to not squander my destiny through pursuing my own self goals.  Give me the courage to
follow you where ever that path may lead me.
