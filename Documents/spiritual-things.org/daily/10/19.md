## Scripture

These proverbs will give insight to the simple, knowledge and discernment to the young.  Let the
wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser.  Let those with understanding receive
guidance by exploring the meaning in these proverbs and parables, the words of the wise and
their riddles.  Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge, but fools despise wisdom
and discipline.

Proverbs 1:4


## Prayer

When we turn away from you all wisdom dies.  Understanding begins by knowing you.  From this
relationship, everything else flows.  Anchor my mind in your truth.
