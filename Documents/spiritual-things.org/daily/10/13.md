# Daily Meditation - October 13

## Scripture

Don't be misled â€” you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant.
Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that
sinful nature. 

Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with
them. 

Galatians 6:6


## Prayer

There are consequences to how I choose to live my life.  I often ignore the long term effects of 
actions until the bill comes due.   This shows up in the way we treat church leader and others in
authority. Teach me how to be a blessing to those that give me so much.
