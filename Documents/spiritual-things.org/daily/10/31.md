# Daily Meditation - October 31

## Scripture

I beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God. Always be humble
and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your
love. Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with
peace.

Ephesians 4:1

## Prayer

You have called me from death to life.  Help me to live consistent with with that calling. Give 
me a attitude of humility so that I treat others as you treat them. Show me when I am manipulating
others for my own gain and teach me to repent so that I can preserve peace and unity.
