# Daily Meditation - November 4

## Scripture

God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.  So humble yourselves before God. Resist the
devil, and he will flee from you. Come  close to God, and God will come close to you.

Wash your hands, you  sinners; purify your hearts, for your loyalty is divided between God and the
world. Let there be tears for what you have done. Let there be sorrow and deep  grief. Let there be
sadness instead of laughter, and gloom instead of  joy. 

Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up in honor.

James 4:7


## Prayer

Humility is an essential part of what it means to follow you.  Pride is the sure sign that we are 
not living in your kingdom and submitting to your will.
