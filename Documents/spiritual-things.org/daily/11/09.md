# Daily Meditation - November 9

## Scripture

Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they couldn't get to him because of the crowd. 

Someone told Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and they want to see you.”

Jesus replied, "My mother and my brothers are all those who hear God's word and obey it.”

Luke 8:19


## Prayer

Help me to see your work in my life as central in the midst of all of the demands that clamor for
my attentions and affections.  Give me the clarity of Jesus in the middle of his busy ministry.
