# Daily Meditation - November 11

## Scripture

Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you
will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks, You
fathers â€” if your children ask for a fish, do you give them a snake instead? Or if they ask for an
egg, do you give them a scorpion? Of course not! So if you sinful people know how to give good
gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who
ask him?

Luke 11:9


## Prayer

As I pray for your will I am certain to receive an answer.  Teach me what you will is so that I
can be aligned with what you are already doing.  Prayer is never about trying to get you to 
perform my will but seeking to do yours.  Show me what that is in each situation.
