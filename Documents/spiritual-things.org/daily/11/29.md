# Daily Meditation - November 29

## Scripture

The Word gave life to everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone. 
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.

So the Word became human and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing love and
faithfulness. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son.

John 1:4


## Prayer

You are light and life itself.  You became human to show us how we can live in unity with your
will.  Teach us your ways of unfailing love and faithfulness so that we can reflect your presence
within us to others.  Let your light extinguish the darkness around us.
