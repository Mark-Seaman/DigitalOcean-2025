# Daily Meditation - November 12

## Scripture

So be careful how you live. Don't live like fools, but like those who are wise. Make the most
of every opportunity in these evil days. Don't act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord
wants you to do. 

Don't be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled
with the Holy Spirit, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making
music to the Lord in your hearts. And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Ephesians 5:15


## Prayer

I don't want to live foolishly.  Teach me to be wise and make the most of the opportunities that
you give me.  Create a heart filled the joy and gratitude for your goodness.
