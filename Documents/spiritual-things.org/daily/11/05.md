# Daily Meditation - November 5

## Scripture

If you enter a town and it welcomes you, eat whatever is set before you. Heal the sick, and
tell them, 'The Kingdom of God is near you now.' But if a town refuses to welcome you, go out
into its streets and say, 'We  wipe even the dust of your town from our feet to show that we
have  abandoned you to your fate. And know this â€” the Kingdom of God is near!' I assure you, even
wicked Sodom will be better off than such a town on judgment day.

Luke 10:8


## Prayer

We are called to give our lives to those that will receive you as king.  This requires us to 
discern those who desire to follow you and not invest our time and energy on those who reject
your authority.  We can move on with a clear conscience that we have done our part.
