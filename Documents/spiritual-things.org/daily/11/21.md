# Daily Meditation - November 21

## Scripture

Look here, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and will stay there a
year. We will do business there and make a profit.” 

How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the morning fog — it's here
a little while, then it's gone. 

What you ought to say is, "If the Lord wants us to, we will live and do this or that.” Otherwise you
are boasting about your own pretentious plans, and all such boasting is evil. Remember, it is sin
to know what you ought to do and then not do it.

James 4:13


## Prayer

It is impossible to fully trust you when I lack the humility to understand that my life is in your
hands and influenced by your will. I have desires and expectations, but help me to hold these 
loosely.  You have the authority and right to take me in any direction from here.  Where ever I end
up will be great if you are leading.
