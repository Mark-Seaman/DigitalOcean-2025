# Daily Meditation - November 17

## Scripture

But that isn't what you learned about Christ. Since you have heard about Jesus and have
learned the truth that comes from him, throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of
life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and
attitudes. Put on your new nature, created to be like God â€” truly righteous and holy.

Ephesians 4:20


## Prayer

I want to live my life in my new nature that is right and pure.  Daily I feel the pull to give into
the corruption of my former way of life.  My animal nature desires to reject your authority and
seek my own selfish will in all things.  I want to let your Spirit renew my thoughts and attitudes.
