# Daily Meditation - November 20

## Scripture

This is how you should pray:
"Father, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon. Give us each day the food we need,
and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. And don't let us yield to
temptation.‚Äù 

Luke 11:2


## Prayer

Every action I do reflects your activity within me.  Help me not to tarnish your reputation by
seeking my own way.  Let me be committed to doing your will.  Provide the resources
needed for me to bless others.  Help me forgive readily and not hold grudges or
seek revenge. Teach me how to walk in alignment with your purpose and not lose my way.  Keep me 
on the narrow highway that leads me to your kingdom.
