# Daily Meditation - November 28

## Scripture

Since  you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven,
where Christ sits in the place of honor at God's right hand. Think about the things of heaven, not
the things of earth. 

For you died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God. And when Christ, who is
your life, is revealed to the whole world, you will share in all his glory.

Colossians 3:3


## Prayer

The quality of my life depends on what fills my thoughts.  By pondering your goodness I see the
world through a different lens.  Your redemptive power can work in every area of my being.  As
I die to myself I am brought to life with you.
