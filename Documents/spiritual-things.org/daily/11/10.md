# Daily Meditation - November 10

## Scripture

Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind
of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they
sound like the truth. 

Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is
the head of his body, the church.

He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps
the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.

Ephesians 4:14


## Prayer

I desire to grow out of my immaturity and learn to speak your truth with love. I am tired of 
being blown about by every new teaching. Give me a resistance to false teaching and let
me hear and believe your truth.
