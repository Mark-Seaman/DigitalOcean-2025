## Scripture

Enter his gates with thanksgiving; go into his courts with praise. Give thanks to him and praise his
name. For the Lord is good. His unfailing love continues forever, and his faithfulness continues to
each generation.

Psalm 100:4

## Prayer

Gratitude is a life changing attitude.  So much of my time is spent grumbling and complaining
but being thankful is a remarkable shift toward you.  Help me to live in a continuous state of 
thankfulness.
