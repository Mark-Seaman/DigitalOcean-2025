## Scripture

This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is God's word. The  seeds that fell on the
footpath represent those who hear the message,  only to have the devil come and take it away from
their hearts and  prevent them from believing and being saved. 

The  seeds on the rocky soil
represent those who hear the message and  receive it with joy. But since they don't have deep
roots, they believe  for a while, then they fall away when they face temptation. 

The  seeds that
fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message,  but all too quickly the message is
crowded out by the cares and riches  and pleasures of this life. And so they never grow into
maturity. 

And  the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted  people who
hear God's word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge  harvest. 

Luke 8:11


## Prayer

Four levels of receptivity to your ways and truth.

* Hard and unyielding
* Enthusiastic but fickle
* Distracted by personal desires
* Desire for deep relationship

Let your truths permeate every part of my being and cause me to pursue you with all of my mind and
heart.  Be my first love.
