# Daily Meditation - November 26

## Scripture

Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other
with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful
hearts. And whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks
through him to God the Father.

Colossians 3:16


## Prayer

May everything that I do or say be a reflection of your work within me.  Fill my life with your
presence and glory.  Let thankfulness and gratitude overflow from me.  And let your message 
always be on my lips.
