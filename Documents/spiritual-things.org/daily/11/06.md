# Daily Meditation - November 6

## Scripture

Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on all of God's armor so that
you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil. For we  are not fighting
against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil  rulers and authorities of the unseen world,
against mighty powers in  this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.

Ephesians 6:10


## Prayer

Help me to discern when to stand firm and when to surrender.  Show me how to pliable and accepting
of all that you are doing in my while being hardened to the temptations that bid me to yield.
I guess this really comes down to understanding the spirits that are the source of motivation.
