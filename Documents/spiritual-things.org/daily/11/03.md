# Daily Meditation - November 3

## Scripture

Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children. Live a life
filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved us and offered himself as a
sacrifice for us, a pleasing aroma to God. 

Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God's
people. Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes â€” these are not for you. Instead, let there
be thankfulness to God. You  can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the
Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater,  worshiping the things of this
world.

Ephesians 5:1


## Prayer

Follow you involves our whole being.  This means living a life of transformation being shaped and
molded to look more like you each day.  If this is happening then it will affect me at every 
level. The evidence is seen in the actions that I take, the way I relate to others.  But it is 
also reflected in how I think and my emotional health.
