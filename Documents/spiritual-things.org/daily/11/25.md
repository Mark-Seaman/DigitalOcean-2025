# Daily Meditation - November 25

## Scripture

He came into the very world he created, but the world didn't recognize him. He came to his own
people, and even they rejected him. 

But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the
right to become children of God. They are reborn â€” not with a physical birth resulting from human
passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.

John 1:10


## Prayer

When you visit us we often don't recognize you.  Even your own people miss it.  Teach me to see
how, when, and where you are moving so that I can partner with you.  Birth in me a deep desire to
be a part of your redemptive plan.
