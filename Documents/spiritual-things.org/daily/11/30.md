# Daily Meditation - November 30

## Scripture

Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted
mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. Make allowance for each other's faults, and
forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. 

Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony. And let the
peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live
in peace. And always be thankful.

Colossians 3:12


## Prayer

Teach me to walk in humility and compassion, always ready to forgive.  Let your love be the primary
characteristic of all my relationships.  Bring your peace into every area of my life.
