# Daily Meditation - November 14

## Scripture

Don't sin by letting anger control you. Don't let the sun go down while you are still
angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil. 

Stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbors the truth, for we are all parts of the same body.

Ephesians 4:25


## Prayer

Being controlled by anger will destroy our relationships with everyone.  We cannot truly connect
with others until we have some humility, because pride justifies our anger.  Lying is a natural
consequence of wanting to look better.  We try to create a false impression and refuse to be
vulnerable to others.  This is a part of a pattern that leads to total isolation over time.
