# Daily Meditation - November 19

## Scripture

Therefore,  put on every piece of God's armor so you will be able to resist the  enemy in the time
of evil. Then after the battle you will still be  standing firm.

Ephesians 6:13


## Prayer

I often don't recognize that there is a battle raging and am unprepared to deal with it. How
I act and relate to others and what I think and feel are all the battleground.  My quality of
life is determined in these arenas.
