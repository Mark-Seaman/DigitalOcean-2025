# Daily Meditation - November 27

## Scripture

So the Word became human and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing love and
faithfulness. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son.

John 1:14


## Prayer

Your incarnation is the greatest mystery that world has ever known.  How is it possible that you
could become a human and experience life and death as we do?  This totally boggles the mind.
Thank you for all that this costs you.  Our lives would have no meaning without this tremendous
sacrifice.
