## Scripture

Don't speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters. If you criticize and judge each
other, then you are criticizing and judging God's law. But your job is to obey the law, not to
judge whether it applies to you. God alone, who gave the law, is the Judge. He alone has the power
to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to judge your neighbor?

James 4:11


## Prayer

I am so quick to judge others by the standards of my life experience.  Yet I fail to realize that
if I had lived their life that I would certainly think differently and make other choices.  Forgive
me for my arrogance and make me aware when this happens.
