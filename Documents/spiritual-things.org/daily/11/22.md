# Daily Meditation - November 22

## Scripture

Suppose you went to a friend's house at midnight, wanting to borrow three loaves of bread. 

You say to him, "A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit, and I have nothing for him to eat."
And suppose he calls out from his bedroom, "Don't bother me. The door is locked for the night, and
my family and I are all in bed. I can't help you." 

But I tell you this â€” though he won't do it for friendship's sake, if you keep knocking long enough,
he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence.

Luke 11:5


## Prayer

I believe prayer is intended to reconcile our will with yours. We are not seeking a specific
outcome but rather a knowledge of your work in the situation.   Sometimes this results in a 
miraculous resolution and at other times you teach us to trust you in our confusion.  As long as
there is still inner conflict then we are invited to be persistently assertive in seeking you.
