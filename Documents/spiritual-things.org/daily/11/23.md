# Daily Meditation - November 23

## Scripture

Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who
disobey him. Don't participate in the things these people do. 

For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of
light! For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true. 

Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness;
instead, expose them. It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in
secret. But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them, for the light
makes everything visible. 

Ephesians 5:6


## Prayer

Your light within me produces fruit that is good and right and pure.  Your light exposes all things,
whether good or evil.  Let your light shine in my life and bring truth into every area.
