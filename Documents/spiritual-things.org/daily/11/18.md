# Daily Meditation - November 18

## Scripture

Then his disciples began arguing about which of them was the greatest. But Jesus knew their
thoughts, so he brought a little child to his side. Then he said to them, "Anyone who welcomes a
little child like this on my behalf welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me also welcomes my
Father who sent me. Whoever is the least among you is the greatest.‚Äù

Luke 9:46


## Prayer

The desire for greatness is rebellion against your will. Our rise to domination is to diminish
and reject your authority to rule and reign. Your kingdom is incompatible with my kingdom.  
I humbly and simply accept your leadership and desire to follow you each day in each choice I
make.  I know that I will fail, but want to be quickly restored when I do.
