# Daily Meditation - November 2

## Scripture

Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists,
and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip God's people to do his work and
build up the church, the body of Christ. 

This  will continue until we all come to such unity in
our faith and  knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up  to the full
and complete standard of Christ.

Ephesians 4:11

## Prayer

The leaders of the church are responsible to equip others to do ministry.  Teaching by example
is the method that you taught your disciples to emulate.  Now it falls to each of us to train
others to walk in your kingdom.
