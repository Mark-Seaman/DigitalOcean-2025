# Daily Meditation - November 7

## Scripture

Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone who he was. "The Son of Man must suffer many
terrible things,” he said. "He  will be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the
teachers  of religious law. He will be killed, but on the third day he will be  raised from the
dead.”

Then he said to the crowd, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way,
take up your cross daily, and follow me. If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it.
But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. And what do you benefit if you gain
the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed? 

If  anyone is ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed  of that person when he
returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels. I tell you the truth, some
standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God.”

Luke 9:21


## Prayer

Death to my way in order to follow Jesus.  These are hard words. If anyone clings to their life
they will lose it.  But to live for God alone is to find the key to eternal and abundant life and
blessing.
