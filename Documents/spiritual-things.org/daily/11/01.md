# Daily Meditation - November 1

## Scripture

Do not withhold good from those who deserve it  when it's in your power to help them. If you can
help your neighbor now, don't say,  "Come back tomorrow, and then I'll help you.‚Äù  Don't plot
harm against your neighbor,  for those who live nearby trust you. Don't pick a fight without
reason,  when no one has done you harm. 

Proverbs 3:27


## Prayer

Show me the opportunities that you put before me.  Teach me to have both the courage and compassion
to act to alleviate the suffering of others.
