# Daily Meditation - November 8

## Scripture

You adulterers! Don't you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of  God? I say
it again: If you want to be a friend of the world, you make  yourself an enemy of God. 

Do  you think the Scriptures have no meaning? They say that God is  passionate that the spirit he
has placed within us should be faithful to  him. And he gives grace generously. 

James 4:4


## Prayer

I want to be your true friend.  Help me receive your generous grace.  Cause me to be faithful to
you so that your will becomes my will.
