# Daily Meditation - November 16

## Scripture

With the Lord's authority I say this: Live no longer as the Gentiles do, for they are hopelessly
confused. Their  minds are full of darkness; they wander far from the life God gives  because
they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against  him. They have no sense of
shame. They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly practice every kind of impurity.

Ephesians 4:17


## Prayer

While many live lives of despair and confusion which leads to every greater darkness, I want to 
live life with you.   Show me how I can more fully experience your presence daily.  I long to know 
you more and the love you deeper.
