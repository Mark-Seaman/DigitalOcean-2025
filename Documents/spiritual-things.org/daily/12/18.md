# Daily Meditation - December 18

## Scripture

Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them. Don't let anyone think less of you
because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in
your love, your faith, and your purity. Until I get there, focus on reading the Scriptures to
the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching them.

1 Timothy 4:11


## Prayer

The way that I live and love speaks volumes to others. My life is an unwritten story that unfolds
gradually each day.  Write your story in me.  Use what I do, say, think, and feel to tell about
your redemptive plan for all of humanity.
