# Daily Meditation - December 4

## Scripture

Jesus told them, "This is the only work God wants from you: Believe in the one he has sent.”

They answered, "Show us a miraculous sign if you want us to believe in you. What can you do? After
all, our ancestors ate manna while they journeyed through the wilderness! The Scriptures
say, 'Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat.'”

Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, Moses didn't give you bread from heaven. My Father did. And now
he offers you the true bread from heaven. The true bread of God is the one who comes down from
heaven and gives life to the world.”

"Sir,” they said, "give us that bread every day.”

Jesus replied, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever
believes in me will never be thirsty. But you haven't believed in me even though you have seen me.

John 6:29


## Prayer

So often we demand that you do do magic tricks for us to convince us that you are real. Yet all
you really ask is that we would trust you completely.  Teach me to accept what you have already 
demonstrated and give me a heart to know you fully.
