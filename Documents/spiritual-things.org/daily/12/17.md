# Daily Meditation - December 17

## Scripture

But don't just listen to God's word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling
yourselves. For if you listen to the word and don't obey, it is like glancing at your face in a
mirror. You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. But if you look
carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don't forget
what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.

James 1:22


## Prayer

For your truth to have a transforming effect it must penetrate to the very core of my being.
A familiarity with truth does little to change me.  What is needed most, is to embrace reality
wholeheartedly and without reservation.
