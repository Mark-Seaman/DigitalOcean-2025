# Daily Meditation - December 27

## Scripture

Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying, "Sovereign Lord, now let
your servant die in peace, as you have promised. I have seen your salvation, which you have
prepared for all people. He is a light to reveal God to the nations, and he is the glory of your
people Israel!‚Äù

Luke 2:28


## Prayer

God has come to earth.  The desolation of our ruin has met the salvation from our God.  How can God
become human and live among us.  This is the greatest mystery in the universe.  It is the basis
of life itself. A mystery that I can never solve defines me.
