# Daily Meditation - December 23

## Scripture

For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. And all who have been united
with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes.

There is no longer
Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. And now
that you belong to Christ, you are the true children of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God's
promise to Abraham belongs to you. 

Galatians 3:26


## Prayer

We are all your children.  Just as removing old dirty clothes and being cleaned and redressed in 
splendor, you have giving us a new life and new desires.

There are many things that separate us into isolated groups, but none of these matter anymore.
We are part of your family now and that is what matters more than wealth and status, gender, race,
culture, or age.  We are one in you.
