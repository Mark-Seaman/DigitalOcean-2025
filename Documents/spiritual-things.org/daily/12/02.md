# Daily Meditation - December 2

## Scripture

In the beginning the Word already existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.

He existed in the beginning with God. God created everything through him, and nothing was created
except through him.

John 1:1


## Prayer

I can never comprehend how you created all things from nothing.  But I acknowledge that you have
created everything that exists.
