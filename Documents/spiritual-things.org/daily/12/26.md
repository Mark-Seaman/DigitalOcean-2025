# Daily Meditation - December 26

## Scripture

People can tame all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, but no one can tame the tongue. It
is restless and evil, full of deadly poison. Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and
sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. 

And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters,
this is not right! Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water? Does a
fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and you can't draw fresh water from a
salty spring.

James 3:7


## Prayer

What we say lies at the heart of our relationships. It demonstrates our maturity and character
and integrity.  It is impossible to hide the evil that lurks within forever.  It is soon exposed
by what is said.  Our words betray our inner health.
