# Daily Meditation - December 3

## Scripture


Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets. And now in
these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an
inheritance, and through the Son he created the universe.

Hebrews 1:1


## Prayer

Thank you for your passion to communicate with us.  Your love has brought redemption and restoration
to me in my brokenness.  I will seek to serve you to the best of my ability.
