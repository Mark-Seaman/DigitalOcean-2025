# Daily Meditation - December 19

## Scripture

I am a sinner if I rebuild the old system of law I already tore down. For when
I tried to keep the law, it condemned me. So I died to the law — I  stopped trying to meet all its
requirements — so that I might live for  God. 

My old self has been crucified with Christ.  It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for
me. I  do not treat the grace of God as meaningless. For if keeping the law could make us right
with God, then there was no need for Christ to die.

Galatians 2:18


## Prayer

Reconciliation with you is never based on my ability to please you or to follow your ways. It is
the result of the transformation that you cause deep within me.  Let your power remake me at the core
so that I can experience the fullness of your life.
