# Daily Meditation - December 11

## Scripture

I tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold,  rather than going through
the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber! But the one who enters through the gate is the
shepherd of the sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his
voice  and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 4 After he has
gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.
They won't follow a stranger; they will run from him because they don't know his voice.

John 10:1


## Prayer

Many would like to separate us from your truth.  They lie in wait to take advantage
of the weak and helpless. Deliver us from these agents of evil and give us an unwavering commitment
to pursue you until the end.
