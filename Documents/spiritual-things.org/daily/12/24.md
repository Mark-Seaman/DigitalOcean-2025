# Daily Meditation - December 24

## Scripture

What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don't show it by your
actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? 

Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, and  you say, "Good-bye and have a
good day; stay warm and eat well” — but then you don't give that person any food or clothing. What
good does  that do? 

So you see, faith by itself isn't enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless. 

James 2:14


## Prayer

Believing in your purpose for my life and your right to guide my daily activity is the kind of
faith that transforms me.  I can believe in a religion or a philosophy but that will not transform
what I do, say, think, or feel. A false faith will focus only on what I say, or perhaps think,
but will be powerless to save me.  This kind of faith is dead and useless.
