# Daily Meditation - December 9

## Scripture

I am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me, just as my Father knows me and I know
the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep. I  have other sheep, too, that are not in this
sheepfold. I must bring  them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock  with
one shepherd.

I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep. A  hired hand will run
when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the  sheep because they don't belong to him and he
isn't their shepherd. And  so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock. The hired hand runs
away because he's working only for the money and doesn't really care about the sheep.


John 10:11


## Prayer

Thank you for your constant care.  Though I frequently turn away from you, your pursuit of me is 
unwavering.  You search me out and restore me.  You truly are the good shepherd of my soul.
