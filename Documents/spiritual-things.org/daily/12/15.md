# Daily Meditation - December 15

## Scripture

I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the
loving mercy of Christ. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News
but is not the Good News at all. 

You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ. Dear brothers and
sisters, I want you to understand that the gospel message I preach is not based on mere human
reasoning. I received my message from no human source, and no one taught me. Instead, I received it
by direct revelation from Jesus Christ.

Galatians 1:6


## Prayer

It is so easy to be deceived into thinking that we are saved by our own efforts to be good.  The
desire to trade my relationship with you for a stale religion is a constant danger. Show me how to
live in an awareness of all that you do in my life.  Do not allow me to drift away from you.
