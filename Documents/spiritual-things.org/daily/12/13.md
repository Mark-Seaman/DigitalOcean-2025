# Daily Meditation - December 13

## Scripture

The people surrounded him and asked, "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are
the Messiah, tell us plainly.” 

Jesus replied, "I have already told you, and you don't believe
me. The proof is the work I do in my Father's name. But you don't believe me because you are not
my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal
life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me, for my Father has given
them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else. No one can snatch them from the Father's
hand. The Father and I are one.”

John 10:24


## Prayer

You came to earth to live as a man so that we could know how to live a life that pleases you.
You also brought redemption to all of us that we could not have apart from your sacrifice.
Thank you for all that you have done.
