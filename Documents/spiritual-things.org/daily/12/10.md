# Daily Meditation - December 10

## Scripture

Let  me put it another way. The law was our guardian until Christ came; it  protected us until we
could be made right with God through faith. And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer
need the law as our guardian.

Galatians 3:24


## Prayer

You put guardrails in our lives to protect us from going astray.  Yet we still go wild anyway.  
Guide me by your Spirit and transform me from the inside to love what you love.
