# Daily Meditation - December 5

## Scripture

My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life. The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and
destroy. 

I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before me were thieves and
robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them. Yes, I am the gate. Those who come in through
me will be saved. They will come and go freely and will find good pastures. 


John 10:6


## Prayer

Thank you for the rich and satisfying life that you offer.  Forgive me for all of the times that 
I have sought to satisfy myself apart from you.  Protect me from false teachers who would seek to
steal, kill, and destroy me.  You are the only source of true life.
