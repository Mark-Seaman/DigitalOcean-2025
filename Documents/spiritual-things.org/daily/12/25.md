## Scripture

And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye when you have a log in your own? 

How can you think of saying to your friend, "Let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye," when you can't see past the log in your own eye? 

Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.

Mathew 7:3


## Prayer

It is so easy to see what is wrong with someone else, but often difficult to 
face the truth about my own failings.  Give me the grace to see things as they
really are.
