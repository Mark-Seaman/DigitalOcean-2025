# Daily Meditation - December 20

## Scripture

The  purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with  love that comes from a
pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine  faith. But  some people have missed this whole
point. They have turned away from  these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions.
They  want to be known as teachers of the law of Moses, but they don't know  what they are talking
about, even though they speak so confidently.

1 Timothy 1:5


## Prayer

Confidence and truth often do not go together.  Help me to see the reality of the world around and
within me.  Give me the courage and wisdom to influence others so that they may know the truth as
well.
