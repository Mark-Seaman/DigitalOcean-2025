# Daily Meditation - December 8

## Scripture

When  I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel message, I  said to Peter in front
of all the others, "Since you, a Jew by birth,  have discarded the Jewish laws and are living like
a Gentile, why are  you now trying to make these Gentiles follow the Jewish traditions?

"You and I are Jews by birth, not 'sinners' like the Gentiles. Yet  we know that a person is made
right with God by faith in Jesus Christ,  not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ
Jesus, so that we  might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not  because we
have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with  God by obeying the law.‚Äù

Galatians 2:14


## Prayer

Hypocrisy so quickly sets in.  Give me the courage to confront the falsehood in my own life so that
I will be able to gently correct it within others.  Teach me humility by allowing me to embrace
my own brokenness and receive your healing.
