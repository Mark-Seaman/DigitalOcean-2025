# Daily Meditation - December 6

## Scripture

Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners â€” and I am the worst of them all. But God had mercy
on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the
worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal
life.

1 Timothy 1:15


## Prayer

You loved me even when I did not love you back.  You have saved my life in every way possible.
Your redemption touches all things.  Thank you for your unwavering love and passion for me.
