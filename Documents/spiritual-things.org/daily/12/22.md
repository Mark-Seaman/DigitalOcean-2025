# Daily Meditation - December 22

## Scripture

Do  not neglect the spiritual gift you received through the prophecy spoken  over you when the
elders of the church laid their hands on you. Give your complete attention to these matters.

Throw yourself into your tasks so that everyone will see your progress. Keep  a close watch on
how you live and on your teaching. Stay true to what  is right for the sake of your own salvation
and the salvation of those  who hear you. 

1 Timothy 4:14


## Prayer

You have created me for a specific purpose and living accordingly fulfills my destiny.  The stakes
are high, not only for me but for those I influence.  Many around me follow my example.  If my
ways are true it leads to salvation but the opposite leads others to destruction.  Make my path
straight.
