# Daily Meditation - December 1

## Scripture

So  put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have  nothing to do with sexual
immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires.  Don't be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater,
worshiping the  things of this world. 

Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming. You used to do these things when your life was
still part of this world. But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behavior,
slander, and dirty language. 

Don't lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds.
Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him. 

In this new life, it doesn't matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile, circumcised or uncircumcised,
barbaric, uncivilized, slave, or free. Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us. 

Colossians 3:5

## Prayer

My ability to deceive myself is a constant danger.  So much of what drives me is opposed to 
your plans for me.  Help me to embrace the true life that you offer and escape the pull toward
the darkness.
