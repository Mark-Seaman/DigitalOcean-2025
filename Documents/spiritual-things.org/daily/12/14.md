# Daily Meditation - December 14

## Scripture

Now the Holy Spirit tells us clearly that in the last times some will turn away from the true
faith; they will follow deceptive spirits and teachings that come from demons. These people are
hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are dead.

They will say it is wrong to be married and wrong to eat certain foods. But  God created those
foods to be eaten with thanks by faithful people who know the truth. Since everything God
created is good, we should not reject any of it but receive it with thanks. For we know it is
made acceptable by the word of God and prayer.

1 Timothy 4:1


## Prayer

We live in a time when propaganda through social media has reached an unprecedented level of
effectiveness.  This toxic barrage of lies threatens our very lives.  False teaching creates
false teachers who take the deception to the next level.  Show me how to speak your truth in
love to those around me.
