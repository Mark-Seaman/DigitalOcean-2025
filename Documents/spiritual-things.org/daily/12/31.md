# Daily Meditation - December 31

## Scripture

Always be full of joy in the Lord. Rejoice! Let everyone see that you are considerate
in all you do. 

Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him
for all he has done. Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can
understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.

Fix your thoughts on what is true, and
honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent
and worthy of praise. Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me â€” everything
you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you.

Philippians 4:4


## Prayer

Let your light permeate my entire being.  May your truth guide my actions, relationships, thoughts,
and feelings.  May each day be focused on you and your will for me.  Thank you for your undying 
love.
