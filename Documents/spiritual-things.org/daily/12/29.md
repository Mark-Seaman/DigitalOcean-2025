# Daily Meditation - December 29

## Scripture

Now  someone may argue, "Some people have faith; others have good deeds.”  But I say, "How can
you show me your faith if you don't have good deeds?  I will show you my faith by my good deeds.”

You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God. Good for you! Even the demons
believe this, and they tremble in terror. How foolish! Can't you see that faith without good
deeds is useless?

James 2:18


## Prayer

True faith changes how I live. It always reveals the things that I actually believe, not what 
I say that value.  Help me to have integrity to serve others.
