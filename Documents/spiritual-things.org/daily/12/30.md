# Daily Meditation - December 30

## Scripture

Don't waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don't throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.

Mathew 7:6


## Prayer

Part of wisdom is knowing when to share something and when to hold back.  Not everyone is ready to
hear the truth and self-restraint is often required.  There is an appropriate time to share the 
truth and this often requires courage and tact.
