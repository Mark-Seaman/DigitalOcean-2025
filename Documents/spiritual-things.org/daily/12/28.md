# Daily Meditation - December 28

## Scripture

Let all that I am praise the Lord; with my whole heart, I will praise his holy name. Let all that I am praise the Lord; may I never forget the good things he does for me.

Psalm 103:2


## Prayer

Worship is a lifestyle.  It is not merely singing songs but a posture of the heart.
You have given me everything that has any value in my life.  May I never forget the good things that you have done.  Let my whole heart resonate with worship.
