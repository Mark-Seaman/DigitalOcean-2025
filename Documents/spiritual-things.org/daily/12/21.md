## Scripture

Yes indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures: "Love your neighbor
as yourself.” But if you favor some people over others, you are committing a sin. You are
guilty of breaking the law.

For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all
of God's laws. For the same God who said, "You must not commit adultery,” also said, "You must
not murder.” So if you murder someone but do not commit adultery, you have still broken the
law.

James 2:8


## Prayer

When we rebel against your will we head down a dark path away from your presence.  This could 
happen in any area of life, but the effect is much the same.  Show me the areas where I am resisting
your will and bring me back to a place of repentance.
