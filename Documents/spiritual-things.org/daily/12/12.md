# Daily Meditation - December 12

## Scripture

Oh,  foolish Galatians! Who has cast an evil spell on you? For the meaning  of Jesus Christ's
death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a  picture of his death on the cross. 

Let  me ask you this one question: Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses? Of
course not! You received the Spirit because  you believed the message you heard about Christ. How
foolish can you be? After starting your new lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become
perfect by your own human effort? Have you experienced so much for nothing? Surely it was not in
vain, was it?

Galatians 3:1


## Prayer

I can never be transformed by trying to follow the rules and be good.  Only your Spirit within me
can change my innermost thoughts.  My beliefs and values drive my behavior.  Without your work in
my life I will continue to grow worse over time.
