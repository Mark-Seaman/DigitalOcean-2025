# Daily Meditation - December 7

## Scripture

Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak,
and slow to get angry. Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires. So
get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the  word God has planted in
your hearts, for it has the power to save your  souls.

James 1:19


## Prayer

What I say reflects what is truly in my heart.  Eventually the truth will come out.  My emotional
health is demonstrated by what I way.  This in turn has a major impact on my relationships.  Make
me aware of how I communicate and maturity that is demonstrated by my interactions with others.
