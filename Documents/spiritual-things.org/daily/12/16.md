# Daily Meditation - December 16

## Scripture

The Father loves me because I sacrifice my life so I may take it back again. No one can take my
life from me. I sacrifice it voluntarily. For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to
and also to take it up again. For this is what my Father has commanded.

John 10:17


## Prayer

Thank you for what you did on the cross to bring salvation to all humanity.  You have saved the
entire world through a sacrifice that was unreasonable in every respect.  Thank you for love 
that knows no limits.
