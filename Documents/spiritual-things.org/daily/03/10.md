# Daily Meditation - March 10

## Scripture

Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of
all that is taught in the law and the prophets.

This is my commandment: Love each other in the
same way I have loved you.  Just as I have loved
you, you should love each other. 

Matthew 7:12, John 13:34, 15:12


## Prayer

Lord, I desire to grow in love toward others.  I confess that the way that I
love is not very similar to the example that you gave us.  Teach me to love
like you love and to be transformed by your powerful love.
