# Daily Meditation - March 15

## Scripture 

You have heard the law that says, "Love your neighbor" and hate
your enemy. But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute
you! 

In  that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in
heaven.  For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends 
rain on the just and the unjust alike. 

If you love only those who love you,
what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. If
you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else?
Even pagans do that. But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven
is perfect.

Matthew 4:43


## Prayer

Help me to see people the way that you see them.  Teach me to love those that 
can not reciprocate or benefit me.  Your love for me has never depended on my
performance.  Let me treat others in the same way.
