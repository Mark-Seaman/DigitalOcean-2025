## Scripture

God blesses those who are humble, for they will inherit the
whole earth. 

God blesses those who mourn,  for they will be
comforted. 

God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice, for
they will be satisfied. 

God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him,  for the
Kingdom of Heaven is theirs. 

Matthew 5:3


## Prayer

Lord, teach me humility and gentleness so that I have a right view of myself 
and others. Teach me how to mourn for the things that are not right and the
injustice that causes such suffering.  Give me a true hunger to see your will
accomplished and a knowledge of my need for you.
