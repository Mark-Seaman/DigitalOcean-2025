# Daily Meditation - March 8

## Scripture

Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give
you everything you need. So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring
its own worries. Today's trouble is enough for today.

Why do  you have so little faith? So don't worry about
these things, saying, "What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?"
These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father
already knows all your needs.  

And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they
grow. They don't work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was
not dressed as beautifully as they are.  And  if God cares so wonderfully for
wildflowers that are here today and  thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will
certainly care for you. 

Matthew 6:25


## Prayer

I confess that I worry a lot about what might happen in the future.  Even though
you have always taken care of all my needs, I still find it difficult to trust
that you will do so in the future.  Create in me the simple trust of a child.
Let confidence in your goodness permeate my thinking and let me be more
generous and open with others. Let your love eliminate my fear.
