# Daily Meditation - March 12

## Scripture

"Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who
builds a house on solid rock. Though  the rain comes in torrents and the
floodwaters rise and the winds beat  against that house, it won't collapse
because it is built on bedrock. 

But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't
obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand. When the rains and
floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a
mighty crash.” 

When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were
amazed at his teaching, for he taught with real authority — quite unlike their
teachers of religious law.

Matthew 7:24


## Prayer

Show me how to build on a solid foundation and the guard against the things that
create risk in my life.  For the rains will come.  Help me to do everything
to prepare for any hard times ahead.
