# Daily Meditation - March 2

## Scripture

And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he
has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of
redemption. 

But that isn't what you learned about Christ. Since you have heard about Jesus
and have learned the truth that comes from him, throw off your old sinful nature
and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. Instead,
let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature,
created to be like Godâ€”truly righteous and holy. 

Ep 4:30, 4:20


## Prayer

Let me live life in a way that brings you joy.  Build in me the spiritual 
fruit so that I can live free of the things that so easily captive and 
addict me.  Renew my thoughts and attitudes to be like your's.
