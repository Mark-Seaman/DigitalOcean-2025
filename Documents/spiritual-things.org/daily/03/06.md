# Daily Meditation - March 6

## Scripture

This is the message we heard from Jesus and now declare to you: God is light,
and there is no darkness in him at all.  So we are lying if we say we have
fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not
practicing the truth.  But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light,
then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son,
cleanses us from all sin.  

1 Jn 1:5


## Prayer

Teach me walk in your light and help me to understand the difference between
light and dark.  Make me a practitioner of your truth.  May your presence
cleanse me from my selfishness. Make my relationships richer as I lay down my
agenda to seek your will.
