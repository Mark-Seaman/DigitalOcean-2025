# Daily Meditation - March 29

## Scripture

I have discovered this principle of life â€” that when I want to do
what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong. I love God's law with all my
heart. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind.

And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I
want to do what is right, but I can't. I want to do what is good, but I
don't. I don't want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. But if I do what
I don't want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me
that does it. 

This power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me. Oh, what a
miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin
and death? 

Thank  God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how
it is: In  my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful
nature  I am a slave to sin.

Romans 7:18


## Prayer

I have a true desire to follow you in honesty and purity.  At the same time
I am drawn into unhealthy and corrupt thought patterns, that ultimately result
in living life in rebellion to your will.  I yield myself afresh to your plans
and ask that you would continue to redeem me in ways that only you can.
