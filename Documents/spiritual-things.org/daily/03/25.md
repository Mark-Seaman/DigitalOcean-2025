## Scripture

If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you.
But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.

And  when you fast, don't make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they  try
to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for  their fasting.
I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will  ever get. But when you
fast, comb your hair and wash your face. Then  no one will notice that you are
fasting, except your Father, who knows  what you do in private. And your Father,
who sees everything, will  reward you.

Matthew 6:14


## Prayer

Help me to forgive easily and release the pain that others have caused me to
you.  Show me when I am seeking the approval of people rather than desiring
to perform for you in private.   Make my heart pure of the complex motives
that so easily capture my attention.
