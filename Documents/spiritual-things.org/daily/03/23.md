## Scripture

If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you.
But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.

And  when you fast, don't make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they  try
to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for  their fasting.
I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will  ever get. 

But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face. Then  no one will notice
that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows  what you do in private. And
your Father, who sees everything, will  reward you.

Matthew 6:14


## Prayer

It is only human to want to appear to be far more spiritual than we actually
are.  God, forgive me for my arrogance and lack of humility.  Show me when I
need to repent of this type of grandstanding.  Give me a pure heart that seeks
only your approval.
