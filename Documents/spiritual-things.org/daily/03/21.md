# Daily Meditation - March 21

## Scripture

And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he
has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of
redemption. 

But that isn't what you learned about Christ. Since you have heard about Jesus
and have learned the truth that comes from him, throw off your old sinful nature
and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception. Instead,
let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes. Put on your new nature,
created to be like God â€” truly righteous and holy. 

Ephesians 4:30, 4:20


## Prayer

Show me how to avoid the things that cause you grief.  I desire to be free of
all the things that cause death, corruption, lust, and deception.  Teach me to
live a life devoted to your purpose and plan for me.  Lead me to train my thoughts
to focus on the life I have in you.
