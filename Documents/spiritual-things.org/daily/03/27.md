# Daily Meditation - March 27

## Scripture

But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have
fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from
all sin.

Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be
healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces
wonderful results.

If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in
the truth. But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness. If we claim we
have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no
place in our hearts.


James 5:16, 1 John 1:7


## Prayer

Confession is should an important part of life.  Help me to see the need to
live a life where repentance is easy and normal.  Let me find regular cleansing
and forgiveness in the presence of your people.  Heal me on the inside and
make my relationships true.
