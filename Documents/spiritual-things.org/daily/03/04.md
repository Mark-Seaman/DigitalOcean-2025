# Daily Meditation - March 4

## Scripture

When troubles come your way, consider it an
opportunity for great joy. For you know that when your faith is tested, your
endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully
developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.

Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us
later. And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good
of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.

James 1:2, Ro 8:18, 8:28


## Prayer

Trouble in our lives is inevitable. When it comes I choose to trust in you and
your presence in my life.
Help me to see it as an opportunity to grow.  Let your endurance get me through
the circumstance and make me a more healthy person as a result.
