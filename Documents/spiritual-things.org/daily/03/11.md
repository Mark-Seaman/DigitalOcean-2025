# Daily Meditation - March 11

## Scripture

You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell is
broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.  But the gateway
to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.

Not  everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of 
Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will  enter. 
On  judgment day many will say to me, 'Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your  name
and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in  your name.' 
But I will reply, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God's
laws.'

Matthew 7:13


## Prayer

It is so easy to deceive myself when it comes to seeing my true motivation.
Give me a pure heart and a deep desire to follow you.  Surround me with men
and women that can inspire me to be more than I am today.  Transform me from 
the inside out.
