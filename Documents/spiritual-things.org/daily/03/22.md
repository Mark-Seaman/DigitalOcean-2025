# Daily Meditation - March 22

## Scripture

God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right, for the Kingdom of Heaven
is theirs.

God  blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you  and
say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my  followers. 12 Be 
happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven.  And
remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.

Matthew 5:10


## Prayer

Lord, I am so often surprised when people do not understand me or misinterpret
my motives.  It is hard for me to overlook the hostility of others and to
see this as a natural consequence of following you.  Help me to put my focus
on you when I am unjustly persecuted because I follow you.
