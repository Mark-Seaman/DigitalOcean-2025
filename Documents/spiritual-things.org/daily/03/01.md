# Daily Meditation - March 1

## Scripture

So be careful how you live. Don't live like fools, but like those who are
wise. Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days. Don't act
thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do. 

Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you
into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know
God's will for you.

Ep 5:15, Ro 12:2


## Prayer

Help me to live a life of honesty and integrity. Allow me to go beyond the
norm of my culture and upbringing.  I desire to experience a personal 
transformation that can only come by truly connecting with you.  May I value
your presence more that anything else in my life.
