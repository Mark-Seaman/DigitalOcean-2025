# Daily Meditation - March 16

## Scripture

Watch out! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you
will lose the reward from your Father in heaven. When  you give to someone in
need, don't do as the hypocrites doâ€”blowing  trumpets in the synagogues and
streets to call attention to their acts  of charity! 

I tell you the truth, they
have received all the reward they  will ever get. But when you give to someone
in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Give
your gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.


Matthew ?:1


## Prayer

Show me how the ways that I desire the applause of people and my desire to 
appear to be devoted to you.  Bring integrity to my motivations and reveal
the hidden hypocrisy that lurks within me.
