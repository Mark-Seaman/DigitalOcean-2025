# Daily Meditation - March 14

## Scripture

No  one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other;  you
will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God  and be
enslaved to money.

Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys
them, and where thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in heaven,
where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. 

Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.

Matthew 6:19

## Prayer

How I view my possessions says a lot about what I value most.  It is easy for
me to express a values that are not what I really treasure.  Help
me to have integrity between what I love and the public image that I wish
to present.
