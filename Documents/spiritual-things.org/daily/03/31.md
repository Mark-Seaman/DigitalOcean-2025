# Daily Meditation - March 31

## Scripture

O Lord, you have examined my heart and know everything about me.

You know when I sit down or stand up. You know my thoughts even when I'm far away.

You see me when I travel and when I rest at home. You know everything I do.

You know what I am going to say even before I say it, Lord.

You go before me and follow me. You place your hand of blessing on my head.

Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too great for me to understand!

Psalm 139:1


## Prayer

Before I even think or feel anything you know about it.  It is pointless to
lie to you.  You know me so much better than I know myself. And you still 
love me.  This boggles my mind.  There are no words that are adequate to thank
you for all that you have done for me.
