# Daily Meditation - March 17

## Scripture

And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that 
darkness is!

But  I warn you â€” unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness  of
the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees, you will never enter  the
Kingdom of Heaven!

Matthew 6:23, 5:20


## Prayer

It is a dangerous thing to think that I am walking in truth when my heart is
far from you.  Let me see my path the way that you see it and have a sober
and honest evaluation of my motives.
