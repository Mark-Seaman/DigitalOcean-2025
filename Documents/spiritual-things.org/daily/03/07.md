# Daily Meditation - March 7

## Scripture

When  you pray, don't babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their 
prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again. Don't be
like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him!

When  you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on 
street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell  you
the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get.  But  when you pray, go
away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray  to your Father in private.
Then your Father, who sees everything, will  reward you.

Mt 6:5 


## Prayer

Lord teach me to pray.  I want to put aside all of the misconceptions and
misunderstanding about prayer. Show me the true heart of prayer that draws me
closer to you.  Help me to truly understand what you desire for my life and
the things that need to change.
