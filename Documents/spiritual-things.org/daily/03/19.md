# Daily Meditation - March 19

## Scripture

You  are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its 
flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled 
underfoot as worthless.

You are the light of the world â€” like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. 
No  one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is 
placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.  In the same
way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise
your heavenly Father.


## Prayer

Make me mindful of the impact that I have on others around me.
Show me how to live life in such a way that I am a positive influence.
I desire to inspire other people by my example so that they are motivated
to follow you more closely.
