# Daily Meditation - March 5

## Scripture

God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward they
will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. 

And
remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, "God is tempting me.‚Äù God is
never tempted to do wrong, and he never tempts anyone else. Temptation comes
from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away. These desires give birth
to sinful actions. And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.

James 1:12


## Prayer

There are many temptations in my life.  But the common element is the desire to
have my own way.  Give me the humility to yield to your goals for my life
over mine.  I know that true life comes only from pursuing your presence 
above anything that might distract me from you.
