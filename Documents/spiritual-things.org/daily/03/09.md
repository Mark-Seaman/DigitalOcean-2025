# Daily Meditation - March 9

## Scripture

Keep  on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and 
you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you. For
everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who
knocks, the door will be opened. 

You parentsâ€”if your children ask for a loaf of
bread, do you give them a stone instead? Or if they ask for a fish, do you
give them a snake? Of course not! 

So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how  much
more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask  him.

Matthew 7:7


## Prayer

You are so generous with your children.  You give me only good gifts.  Forgive
me for not acknowledging your goodness in my life.  Help me to pay attention
to the generosity that you show and the kindness that you demonstrate.
