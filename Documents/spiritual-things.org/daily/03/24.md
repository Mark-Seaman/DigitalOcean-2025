# Daily Meditation - March 24

## Scripture

Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really
vicious wolves.  You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way
they act. Can you pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? A good
tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit. 

A good tree
can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit. So every
tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.
Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people
by their actions.

Matthew 7:15


## Prayer

Lord, give me discernment to distinguish between good and evil. There are
many that live a life of deceit, subterfuge, and sabotage. Help me to avoid 
their traps and the protect others as well.
