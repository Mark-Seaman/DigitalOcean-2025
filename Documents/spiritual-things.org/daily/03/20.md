## Scripture

God blesses those who are merciful,    for they will be shown mercy.

God blesses those whose hearts are pure,    for they will see God.

God blesses those who work for peace,    for they will be called the children of
God.

Matthew 5:7


## Prayer

Help me to be more merciful in how and treat others.  Let me feel your compassion
for the people that surround me.  Give me a pure heart to see the world as
you see it.  And show me ways in which I can bring your peace to others.
