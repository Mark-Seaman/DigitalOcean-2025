# Daily Meditation - March 3

## Scripture

Now I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this
world so they would be filled with my joy. I have given them your word. And the
world hates them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not
belong to the world. 

I'm not asking you to take them out of the world, but to
keep them safe from the evil one. They do not belong to this world any more than
I do. Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is truth. Just
as you sent me into the world, I am sending them into the world. And I give
myself as a holy sacrifice for them so they can be made holy by your truth.

John 17:13


## Prayer

We are not really citizens of this world, as we are true citizens of your kingdom.
Help me to keep this clear in my thinking.  It is so easy to have conflicting
allegiance and end up serving the wrong authority.  Help me to serve your 
will and then to be a blessing to my community and nation.
