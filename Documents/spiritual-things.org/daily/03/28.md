# Daily Meditation - March 28

## Scripture

Believers who are poor have something to boast about, for God has honored them.
And those who are rich should boast that God has humbled them. 

They will fade
away like a little flower in the field. The hot sun rises and the grass withers;
the little flower droops and falls, and its beauty fades away. In the same way,
the rich will fade away with all of their achievements.

James 1:9


## Prayer

Whether I am rich or poor, I am completely dependent on your mercy for 
everything that is good in my life.  It is not my achievements or my life
challenges that make me who I am. I confess that you are my everything and
you are the source of all life.  This gives me both a profound humility and
security.
