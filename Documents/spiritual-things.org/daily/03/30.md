# Daily Meditation - March 30

## Scripture

But I am like an olive tree, thriving in the house of God. I will always trust
in God's unfailing love.

I will praise you forever, O God, for what you have done.

I will trust in your good name in the presence of your faithful people.

Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand
around with sinners, or join in with mockers.

But they delight in the law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night.

They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season.
Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do.

Psalm 52:8,  Psalm 1:1


## Prayer

There is joy and freedom that can be found only in your presence.  Let your
health flourish in me and may it be the foundation of the rich life.  Prune
away everything that is not like you so that I can be more like you each day.
