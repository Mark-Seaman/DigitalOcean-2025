# Daily Meditation - August 9

## Scripture

When troubles of any kind come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. For you know that
when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your
endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.

James 1:2


## Prayer

Lord, have your way in me.  Give me the courage to whether any storm that comes.  Let endurance
result in growth of character.  Teach me the joy that can be found in the midst of the hardship.
Guide me with an unwavering faith in your goodness.
