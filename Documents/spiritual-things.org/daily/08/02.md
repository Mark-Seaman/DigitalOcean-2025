# Daily Meditation - August 2

## Scripture

I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God is calling us.
I  want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him  from the dead. I want to
suffer with him, sharing in his death, so that one way or another I will experience the
resurrection from the dead! 

Philippians 3:15


## Prayer

There are many aspects of your kingdom that you invite us to share in.  I want to experience it 
all.  No matter where it will lead or what is in store, I want to know you.  Help me to pursue
your will wholeheartedly and without reservation.
