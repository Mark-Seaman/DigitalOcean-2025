# Daily Meditation - August 22

## Scripture

My heart is breaking as I remember how it used to be: I walked among the crowds of worshipers,
leading a great procession to the house of God, singing for joy and giving thanks amid the sound of
a great celebration!

Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God! I will praise him again —
my Savior and my God! 

Now I am deeply discouraged, but I will remember you — even from a distant land. I hear the
tumult of the raging seas as your waves and surging tides sweep over me. But each day the Lord
pours his unfailing love upon me,  and through each night I sing his songs, praying to God who
gives me life.

Psalm 42:4


## Prayer

I often have times when I feel this way.  I need your presence in my life to get me through.  
Teach me to trust in you when I cannot see the path forward.
