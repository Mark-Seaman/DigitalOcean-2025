# Daily Meditation - August 11

## Scripture

So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters. Whatever is good and perfect is a gift coming down
to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens. He never changes or casts a
shifting shadow.  He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word. And we, out of all
creation, became his prized possession.

James 1:16


## Prayer

Lord, I receive everything good as coming from you.  I acknowledge your amazing provision in my 
life.  Help me to be responsible with all you have provided and responsive to care for others.
