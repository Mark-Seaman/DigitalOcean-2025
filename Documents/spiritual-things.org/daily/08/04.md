# Daily Meditation - August 4

## Scripture

But don't just listen to God's word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling
yourselves. For if you listen to the word and don't obey, it is like glancing at your face in a
mirror. You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. But  if you look carefully into
the perfect law that sets you free, and if  you do what it says and don't forget what you heard,
then God will bless  you for doing it.

James 2:22


## Prayer

Fooling myself is something that is so easy to do.  Self-deception starts with the simple lie
that I am behaving and thinking in a way that is consistent with your will.  This leaves me open
to every other kind of deception and makes me resist any correction.
