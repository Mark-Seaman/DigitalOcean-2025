# Daily Meditation - August 28

## Scripture

Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak,
and slow to get angry. Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires. So
get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the  word God has planted in
your hearts, for it has the power to save your  souls.

James 1:19


## Prayer

Help me control what I say.  This reflects what is truly happening in my heart. Show me how 
my communication with others influences my overall life.
