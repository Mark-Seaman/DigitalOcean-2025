# Daily Meditation - August 16

## Scripture

God blesses those who are merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.

God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right,
for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.

Matthew 5:7


## Prayer

Let mercy and justice be characteristics that are clearly seen in my life.  And may your humility
and kindness be evident in all I do.  Put an end to any remaining arrogant militancy that would
raise its ugly head and damage your reputation.
