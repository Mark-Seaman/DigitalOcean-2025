## Scripture

God blesses those who are humble, for they will inherit the whole earth. 

God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they will be satisfied.

Matthew 5:5


## Prayer

I confess that pride so often blocks me from turning to you.  My desire for control is
the main reason that rebel against your will.  I long to control myself, others, and the
world around me.  

Justice and compassion require a deep humility.  Pride twists everything so that I am concerned
only when I am directly victimized, but care little about how others suffer.  Give me a heart 
that is inclined toward humility and justice and compassion for all.
