# Daily Meditation - August 10

## Scripture

No  one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other;  you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God  and be enslaved to money.

That  is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life â€” whether you have  enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than  food, and your body more than clothing? Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?

Matthew 6:24


## Prayer

I am grateful for all of your provision and acknowledge that everything that is truly valuable comes
from you.  Yet, I am quick to doubt your provision when I face difficulties and hardships.  Give me
a quiet trusting heart that is responsive to your voice above the din of confusion that surrounds
me.
