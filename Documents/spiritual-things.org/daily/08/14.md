# Daily Meditation - August 14

## Scripture

Look  at the birds. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for  your heavenly Father
feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to him  than they are? 

And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don't
work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they
are. And  if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and  thrown into the fire
tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do  you have so little faith?

Matthew 6:26


## Prayer

You provide all that  is needed for the life that you wish me to live.  Forgive me for the times
when I doubt your goodness.  Even when I am faithless, you are faithful because it is your nature.
