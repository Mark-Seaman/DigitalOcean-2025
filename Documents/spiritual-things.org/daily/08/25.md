# Daily Meditation - August 25

## Scripture

This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God's weakness is stronger
than the greatest of human strength.

Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful or
wealthy when God called you. Instead,  God chose things the world considers foolish in order to
shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are
powerful. 

God chose things despised by the world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring
to nothing what the world considers important. As a result, no one can ever boast in the
presence of God.

1 Corinthians 1:25 


## Prayer

We like to believe that our plans are so wise and our intentions are so pure, but this is not
true.  At our best we come nowhere close to truly understanding how the world works.  Your 
wisdom is so far beyond anything that we can grasp.  Yet you bring your truth and your presence 
to me in a way that makes sense.
