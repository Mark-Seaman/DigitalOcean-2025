## Scripture

God blesses those whose hearts are pure, for they will see God. 

God blesses those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God.

Matthew 5:8


## Prayer

Sometimes my mind and heart are like a raging torrent.  There are many things that I seek that
are not aligned with your purpose.  Help me to be transformed by your Spirit to seek peace and
justice. I desire to be your representative by showing compassion and humility for all.
