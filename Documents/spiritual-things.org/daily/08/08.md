## Scripture

God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him,
for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.

God blesses those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.

Matthew 5:2


## Prayer

Lord, I am in constant need of you for every aspect of my life.  Even when I don't realize it, I
rely on you for everything.  Mourning happens when I feel the loss and I reach for the answers
that only you can provide.  Apart from your kingdom I am indeed impoverished. Yet I build walls
of protection to forget this reality.  I admit that I need you more than ever.
