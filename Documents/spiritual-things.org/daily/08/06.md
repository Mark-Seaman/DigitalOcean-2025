## Scripture

What  good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but  don't show it by your
actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food
or clothing,  and  you say, "Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well” — but  then you
don't give that person any food or clothing. What good does  that do?  So you see, faith by
itself isn't enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.

James 2:14


## Prayer

Lord, help me to live out my faith in a way that is both practical and useful.  Create in me a
deep compassion and humility.  Let me help those who are in distress and care about those who are
unlike me. Let me treat others as I wish to be treated.
