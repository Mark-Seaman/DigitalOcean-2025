# Daily Meditation - August 23

## Scripture

I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to
live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind,
united in thought and purpose. 

Some of you are saying, "I am a follower of Paul.” Others are saying, "I follow Apollos,” or "I
follow Peter,” or "I follow only Christ.” Has Christ been divided into factions? Was I
crucified for you? Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul? Of course not! 

1 Corinthians 1:10


## Prayer

Living in harmony can be a difficult thing.  Others have ideas and sensitivities that I do not
share. It can be hard to accept others as they are rather than as I want them to be. Help me lay
down my need to control what people think and let me simply love them where they are at.
