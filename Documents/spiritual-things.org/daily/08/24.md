# Daily Meditation - August 24

## Scripture

You are the light of the world â€” like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden. No one lights a lamp
and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to
everyone in the house. In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that
everyone will praise your heavenly Father.

Matthew 5:14


## Prayer

Help me to be a beacon of light and hope for those around me.  Show me how to influence others
gently and peacefully. Make me a force for good and give me the ability to connect deeply with 
empathy and compassion.
