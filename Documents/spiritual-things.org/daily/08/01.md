# Daily Meditation - August 1

## Scripture

I  want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him  from the dead and I want to
suffer with him. I  don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I  have
already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that  perfection for which Christ Jesus first
possessed me. I have not achieved it, but I focus on this one thing: Forgetting the past and
looking forward to what lies ahead, I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the
heavenly prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us.

Philippians 3:10


## Prayer

You Spirit is at work within me, refining and perfecting me from the inside out.  This
transformation is the essence of my life and its ultimate purpose.  Nothing I seek beyond this
work has value that can even be compared.  I must forget about yesterday and tomorrow to focus
on experiencing you today.
