# Daily Meditation - August 3

## Scripture

Don't  misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of  Moses or the writings of
the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their  purpose. 

I  tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the  smallest detail of God's law
will disappear until its purpose is  achieved. So  if you ignore the least commandment and teach
others to do the same,  you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys
God's laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of  Heaven.

But  I warn youâ€”unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness  of the teachers of
religious law and the Pharisees, you will never enter  the Kingdom of Heaven!

Matthew 5:17


## Prayer

Your standard and expectation for my behavior is indeed high.  But you desire transformation more
than simple conformity.  There are many religious people that live lives of outward righteous 
while cultivating their own selfish interests.  These people are not walking under your rule and
reign.  Pursuing your kingdom means laying down the desire to be perceived as righteous by others.
