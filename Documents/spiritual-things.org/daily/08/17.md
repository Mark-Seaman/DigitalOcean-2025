# Daily Meditation - August 17

## Scripture

If you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your
religion is worthless. 

Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for
orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.

James 1:26


## Prayer

It is so hard sometimes, to control what I say.  Help me to have the integrity to be restrained when
communicating with others.  Authentic spirituality means caring about the welfare of others and
helping those in distress.
