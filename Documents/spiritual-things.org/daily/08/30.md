# Daily Meditation - August 30

## Scripture

My dear brothers and sisters, how can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ
if you favor some people over others? For example, suppose someone comes into your meeting
dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in
dirty clothes. If  you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you  say to
the poor one, "You can stand over there, or else sit on the  floor” — well, doesn't this
discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives? 

Listen  to me, dear brothers
and sisters. Hasn't God chosen the poor in this  world to be rich in faith? Aren't they the ones
who will inherit the  Kingdom he promised to those who love him? But you dishonor the poor! Isn't
it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court? Aren't they the ones who slander Jesus
Christ, whose noble name you bear?

James 2:2


## Prayer

When I show favoritism, it demonstrates that I am seeking to serve others that can help me in
return.  I pander to the rich and powerful because I want to benefit from the relationship.  On
the other hand I refuse to embrace the weak and poor because I know it will cost me something
that will never be repaid.  Forgive me for my shortsightedness.
