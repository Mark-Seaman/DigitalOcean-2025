# Daily Meditation - August 19

## Scripture

I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now that you belong to
Christ Jesus. Through him, God has enriched your church in every way â€” with all of your eloquent
words and all of your knowledge. 

Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus
Christ. He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when
our Lord Jesus Christ returns. God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has
invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

1 Corinthians 1:4


## Prayer

Thank you for your empowerment.  You provide everything that is needed to live our life together.
We eagerly await the transformation that you bring to us.  We can rely on your faithfulness to
see us through every challenge.
