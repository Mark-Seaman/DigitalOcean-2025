# Daily Meditation - August 26

## Scripture

Don't worry about these things, saying, "What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?"
These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your
needs. 

So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's trouble is
enough for today.

Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything
you need.

Matthew 6:31


## Prayer

So much of my life is consumed with petty things of trying to make a living, trying to get ahead,
and trying to control others.  Help me to focus on the essential things.  Your leadership and 
authority are the basis of all meaningful engagement.  Teach me to pursue obedience and submission
to your will above all else.
