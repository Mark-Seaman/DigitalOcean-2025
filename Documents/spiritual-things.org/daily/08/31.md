# Daily Meditation - August 31

## Scripture

The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! 
So  where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world's  brilliant debaters? God
has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. Since  God in his wisdom saw to it that the world
would never know him through  human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who
believe. 

1 Corinthians 1:18


## Prayer

Embracing the truth requires humility.  Those that believe in their own wisdom miss the truths that
you offer.  Help me to embrace your reality even when I don't understand all of the details.  Teach
me to say, "YES" to you - no matter what you ask.
