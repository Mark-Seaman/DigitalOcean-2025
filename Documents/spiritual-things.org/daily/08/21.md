# Daily Meditation - August 21

## Scripture

You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it
salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.

Matthew 5:13


## Prayer

Salt preserves the goodness of food and gives it flavor. But if its effectiveness is lost then 
it becomes worthless.  This is a picture of my life within the community where I live.  If I stop
being your presence with the people I interact with then why stay on this earth?  Is my life nothing 
more than fulfilling my desires?
