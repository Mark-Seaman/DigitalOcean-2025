# Daily Meditation - August 29

## Scripture

When  you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on  street corners and in the
synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell  you the truth, that is all the reward they will
ever get. But  when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray  to your
Father in private. 

Then your Father, who sees everything, will  reward you.

And  when you fast, don't make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they  try to look miserable and
disheveled so people will admire them for  their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only
reward they will  ever get. But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face. 

Then  no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows  what you do in
private. And your Father, who sees everything, will  reward you.

Matthew 6:5


## Prayer

Practicing righteousness as a public spectacle is a horrible thing.  It is a sick attempt to appear
that I am more devoted to you than I really am.  In a bid for impressing others I sacrifice
my authenticity, humility, and integrity.
