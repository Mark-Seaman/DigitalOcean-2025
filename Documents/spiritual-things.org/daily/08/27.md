# Daily Meditation - August 27

## Scripture

The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are
being saved know it is the very power of  God. It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from
heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom. So when we preach that Christ
was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it's all nonsense. But to those called
by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. 

1 Corinthians 1:18


## Prayer

So often I turn away for the truth because it does not fit neatly into my worldview.  I use my
current understanding to limit what I allow myself to see.  This means that I am blinded to my own 
need for growth.  Observation bias often becomes a prison in my thinking.  Set me free and I will
be free indeed.
