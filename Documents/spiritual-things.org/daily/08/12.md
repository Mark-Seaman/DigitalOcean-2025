# Daily Meditation - August 12

## Scripture

You have heard the law that says, 'Love your neighbor' and hate your enemy. But I say, love your
enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! 

If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do
that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even
pagans do that. 

Matthew 5:43


## Prayer

Let my life be characterized by your unfailing love.  Help me forgive others freely and love
unconditionally.  I confess that this is not natural at all for me.  Show me how to operate in
a way that is supernatural.
