# Daily Meditation - August 18

## Scripture

Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where
thieves break in and steal. Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy,
and thieves do not break in and steal. 

Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be. Your eye is like a lamp
that provides light for your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is filled with light.
But when your eye is unhealthy, your whole body is filled with darkness.  And if the light you
think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!

Matthew 6:19


## Prayer

Lord, help me to see clearly.  I desire to see reality as it is rather than as I wish
it to be.  I want to value things the way that you do so that I can be free from any potential
bondage.
