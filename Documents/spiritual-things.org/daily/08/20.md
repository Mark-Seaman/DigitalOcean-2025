# Daily Meditation - August 20

## Scripture

Now  someone may argue, "Some people have faith; others have good deeds.”  But I say, "How can you
show me your faith if you don't have good deeds?  I will show you my faith by my good deeds.”

You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God. Good for you! Even the demons believe
this, and they tremble in terror. How foolish! Can't you see that faith without good deeds is
useless? Just as the body is dead without breath, so also faith is dead without good works.

James 2:18


## Prayer

Show me how to live in the balance between striving and resting.  Action and Faith are not choices,
since both of them are important and must be actively managed.  Help me to live with this tension.
Let me demonstrate deep faith by acting it out in real life.
