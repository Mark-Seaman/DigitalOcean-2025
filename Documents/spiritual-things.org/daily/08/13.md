# Daily Meditation - August 13

## Scripture

And remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, "God is tempting me.‚Äù God is never tempted to
do wrong, and he never tempts anyone else. Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us
and drag us away. These desires give birth to sinful actions. And when sin is allowed to grow, it
gives birth to death.

James 1:13


## Prayer

I am often quick to want to blame you for things that are wrong in my life.  But if I am honest,
it is clear that you provide everything that is worthwhile.  It is my human nature that causes me
to run after idols and seek things that are opposed to your rule.  When I fall it is never your
failure, but the human weakness that trips me up.
