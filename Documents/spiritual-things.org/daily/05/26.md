# Daily Meditation - May 26

## Scripture

Because of the miraculous signs Jesus did in Jerusalem at the Passover
celebration, many began to trust in him. 

But Jesus didn't trust them, because
he knew all about people. 

No one needed to tell him about human nature, for
he knew what was in each person's heart.

John 2:23


## Prayer

We trust in you because there are many benefits that come to us as we follow
you.  But you know how tenuous our allegiance truly is.  When we no longer
feel your blessing or experience hardship then we are likely to turn away from
your presence.  This is the very time we need you most.
