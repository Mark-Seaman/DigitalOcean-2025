# Daily Meditation - May 16

## Scripture

What is causing the quarrels and fights among you? Don't they come from the evil
desires at war within you? You want what you don't have, so you scheme and kill
to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you can't get it, so you
fight and wage war to take it away from them. 

Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it. And even when
you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrongâ€”you want only what
will give you pleasure.

James 4:1


## Prayer

Forgive me for my greed, that causes me to think so selfishly.  I am willingly
to let others suffer as long as my needs are met.  Give me a generous heart -
filled with your compassion.  Teach me to be content and absolutely dependent
on you.
