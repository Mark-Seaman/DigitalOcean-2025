# Daily Meditation - May 21

## Scripture

May God, who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete
harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus. Then all
of you can join together with one voice, giving praise and glory to God, the
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Romans 5:16


## Prayer

May my interactions with others be heavily flavored with patience,
encouragement, and harmony.  These are the key ingredients of a unity that we
can't achieve without your transformation.   Work in my heart to make this a
reality for me.
