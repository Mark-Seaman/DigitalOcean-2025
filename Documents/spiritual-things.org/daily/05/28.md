# Daily Meditation - May 28

## Scripture

Pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your
Kingdom come soon. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us
today the food we need, and forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those
who sin against us. And don't let us yield to temptation, but rescue us from
the evil one.

Matthew 6:9


## Prayer

You are my Father, that brought me to life and continues to give me life.
My I live in such a way to not tarnish your reputation. Show me how to partner
with you in your work on this earth.  Let me act as you would for those around
me.

Supply everything that is needed to live a fulfilling life, while being generous
with everyone.   Bring an abundance that can be invested to reduce the suffering
that surrounds me. 

Help me never to hold a grudge and the forgive easily, even those who have 
hurt me intentionally.  Heal the wounds that have happened from the past. 

Give me strength when I am tempted to give up, run away, or 
turn my back.  Rescue me from the pull of corruption and despair.

I know that you have the power to do this in me.
