# Daily Meditation - May 29

## Scripture

My nourishment comes from doing the will of God, who sent me, and from finishing
his work.  

You know the saying, "Four months between planting and harvest." But I say, wake
up and look around. The fields are already ripe for harvest.  

The  harvesters are paid good wages, and the fruit they harvest is people 
brought to eternal life. What joy awaits both the planter and the  harvester
alike!  

You know the saying, "One plants and another harvests." And it's true. I sent
you to harvest where you didn't plant; others had already done the work, and now
you will get to gather the harvest.

John 4:34


## Prayer

I know that you have set aside tasks that you wish for me to accomplish. There
is a harvest that you have invited me to participate in.  I know that there 
are as many roles in your harvest as there are people willing to sign up for
the work crews.  Show me my place.  Teach me to serve in the exact role that
you have picked for me.
