## Scripture

For if we could control our tongues, we would be perfect and could also control
ourselves in every other way.

We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in its
mouth. And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to
go, even though the winds are strong. In the same way, the tongue is a small
thing that makes grand speeches.

But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. And among all the parts of the
body, the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness,
corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set
on fire by hell itself.

James 3:2


## Prayer

What we say to others always reveals our true heart.  If there is trouble brewing
deep within it will come out in how I relate to those around me.  Cleanse my 
inner being so that I don't share the poison that lurks there with others.  
Make me aware of how my words hurt and wound.  Show me a better way to live.
