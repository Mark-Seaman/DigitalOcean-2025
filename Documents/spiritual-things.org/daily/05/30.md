# Daily Meditation - May 30

## Scripture

Watch out! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you
will lose the reward from your Father in heaven.  When  you give to someone in
need, don't do as the hypocrites doâ€”blowing  trumpets in the synagogues and
streets to call attention to their acts  of charity! 

I tell you the truth, they
have received all the reward they  will ever get.  But when you give to someone
in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Give your
gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.


Matthew 6:2


## Prayer

Lord, forgive me for my desire to attract the applause of others.  I realize
that this prevents me from truly loving them and makes even the most generous
action selfish.  Grant me pure motives that seek to honor you alone without
regard to how I am seen by others.  Teach me to be generous in secret.
