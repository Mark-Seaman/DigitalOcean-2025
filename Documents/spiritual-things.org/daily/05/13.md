# Daily Meditation - May 13

## Scripture

So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 
Come close to God, and God will come close to you. 

So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he
will lift you up in honor. Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares
about you.

Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a
roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. Stand firm against him, and be
strong in your faith.


James 1:7, 1 Peter 5:6


## Prayer

Humility is never a natural thing for me.  And yet it is necessary to see from
your perspective.  Show me my life through your eyes and let your love permeate
my soul.  Give me a focus on understanding your kingdom and a will to follow you
completely.
