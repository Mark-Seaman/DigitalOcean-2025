# Daily Meditation - May 19

## Scripture

But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle
at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and the fruit
of good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere. And those who are
peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness.

James 3:17


## Prayer

Your wisdom has the same character as you do.  I desire to take on these traits
by understanding your wisdom.  I want to be pure, peace loving, gentle, willing
to yield, merciful, and without prejudice.  Teach me your ways.  Help me learn to 
love as you love.
