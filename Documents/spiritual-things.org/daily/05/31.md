# Daily Meditation - May 31

## Scripture

And  when you fast, don't make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for
they  try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for  their
fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will  ever get. 
But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face. 

Then  no one will
notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows  what you do in
private. And your Father, who sees everything, will  reward you.

Matthew 6:14


## Prayer

Forgive me for how I practice righteous deed in public to gain the adoration
of others.  I acknowledge that the completely nullifies the value of the 
activity and is offensive to you.  It is simply a way to leverage our relationship
to meet my own ego needs.
