# Daily Meditation - May 10

## Scripture

Don't speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters.  If you
criticize and judge each other, then you are criticizing and  judging God's law.
But your job is to obey the law, not to judge whether  it applies to you.  God 
alone, who gave the law, is the Judge. He alone has the power to save  or to
destroy. So what right do you have to judge your neighbor?

Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.  For you will be treated as you
treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will
be judged.

1 Co 1:11, Matthew 7:1


## Prayer

Criticism and sniping are deadly practices that victimize the target and corrupt
the perpetrator.  Judgment is the foundation of all systematic hatred which 
is used to justify injustice.  Reveal areas in my life where I have allowed
the toxic impact of judgment to take root.
