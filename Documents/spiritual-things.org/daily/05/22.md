# Daily Meditation - May 22

## Scripture

But Peter and the apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than any human
authority. The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead after you killed
him by hanging him on a cross. Then God put him in the place of honor at his
right hand as Prince and Savior. He did this so people would
repent of their sins and be forgiven. We are witnesses of these things and so is
the Holy Spirit, who is given by God to those who obey him.” 

When they heard this, the high council was furious and decided to kill them.The
apostles left the high council rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to
suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus. And every day, in the Temple and from
house to house, they continued to teach and preach this message: "Jesus is the
Messiah.”

Acts 5:29


## Prayer

Give me courage to act on what I know, no matter what the reactions of others
might be.  Truth does not change when it becomes unpopular.  Show me how to
walk in the reality of your kingship even if I must stand alone or against the
crowd.
