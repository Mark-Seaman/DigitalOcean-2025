# Daily Meditation - May 18

## Scripture

Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really
vicious wolves.  You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way
they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?  A good
tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.  

A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit. 
So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into
the fire.  Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can
identify people by their actions.

Matthew 7:15


## Prayer

Give me to discernment that I need to tell what is true and false.  So many 
are interested in furthering their own private agenda even when it hurts others.
Give me the courage to confront evil in all of its forms, and the humility to
know when to accept the leadership of others.  Wisdom is found by understanding
when to push and when to be passive.
