# Daily Meditation - May 6

## Scripture

The  message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for  destruction!
But we who are being saved know it is the very power of  God. As the Scriptures
say, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and discard the intelligence of
the intelligent.‚Äù

So  where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world's 
brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. Since 
God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through  human
wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who  believe. 

It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to
the Greeks, who seek human wisdom. So when we preach that Christ was crucified,
the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it's all nonsense.

I Co 1:18


## Prayer

Much truth can only be understood when coupled with faith. There are some things
that can only be embraced in the light of personal transformation.  Your
kingdom is offensive to the unredeemed mind.  Convert me completely so that
I can see the world with your love. The lens of self-interests will always be
blinders that prevent me from seeing with clarity.
