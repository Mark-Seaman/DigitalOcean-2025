# Daily Meditation - May 11

## Scripture

Because  of God's grace to me, I have laid the foundation like an expert 
builder. Now others are building on it. But whoever is building on this 
foundation must be very careful.  For no one can lay any foundation other than
the one we already have — Jesus Christ.

Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials — gold,
silver, jewels, wood, hay, or straw. But  on the judgment day, fire will reveal
what kind of work each builder  has done. The fire will show if a person's work
has any value.  

If the work survives, that builder will receive a reward.  But 
if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The  builder will
be saved, but like someone barely escaping through a wall  of flames.

1 Co 3:10


## Prayer

Thank you for the good foundation that you have built in my life.  I truly 
appreciate all those who have invested in me to teach me your ways.  Now help
me to walk in wisdom and truth and build upon what they started.  Alert me
when I am leaving your path to follow my own agenda.
