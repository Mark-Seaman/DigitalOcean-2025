# Daily Meditation - May 24

## Scripture

When  you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on 
street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell  you
the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get. 

But  when you pray, go
away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray  to your Father in private.
Then your Father, who sees everything, will  reward you.

When  you pray, don't babble on and on as the Gentiles do. They think their 
prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again. Don't be
like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him! 

Matthew 6:5


## Prayer

Prayer is not a performance. It is an opportunity for confession, repentance,
and seeking your will.  Help me to be alive to you and dead to my own ego.  
I truly desire to know you, in the good times and the bad times.
