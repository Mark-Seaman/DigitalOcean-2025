# Daily Meditation - May 15

## Scripture

Carefully determine what pleases the Lord. Take no part in the worthless deeds
of evil and darkness; instead, expose them. It is shameful even to talk about
the things that ungodly people do in secret. But their evil intentions will be
exposed when the light shines on them, for the light makes everything visible. 

And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he
has identified you as his own, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of
redemption. 

Ephesians 5:10, 4:30


## Prayer

Thank you for the redemption and cleansing that you brought to my life. Help 
me to walk in a way that honors the work you have done and brings you joy.
I desire to live out the freedom that you have bought for me with the life and
resurrection of Jesus.  Teach me daily to bring light in this world.
