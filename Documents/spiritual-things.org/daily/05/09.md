# Daily Meditation - May 9

## Scripture

To those called by God, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.  This 
foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God's  weakness
is stronger than the greatest of human strength. Remember, dear brothers and
sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful or wealthy
when God called you.  

Instead,  God chose things the world considers foolish in
order to shame those  who think they are wise. And he chose things that are
powerless to shame  those who are powerful.  God chose things despised by the
world, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what
the world considers important.  As a result, no one can ever boast in the
presence of God.

1 Co 1:24


## Prayer

Your wisdom is so different from how we naturally look at the world.  
At first is seems ridiculous but there is a correctness that resonates deep 
within my spirit.  Eventually it becomes the obvious truth that I can't 
believe I missed for years.  Let your truth ring out within me.
