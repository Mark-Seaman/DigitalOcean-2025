# Daily Meditation - May 23

## Scripture

We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they
help us develop endurance.  And endurance develops strength of character, and
character strengthens our confident hope of salvation.  And this hope will not
lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has
given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.

Romans 5:3

## Prayer

Difficulties and problems are a reality of life.  Fill my heart with your love
so that I can perceive the world around me as you do.  Let endurance produce
hope within me.
