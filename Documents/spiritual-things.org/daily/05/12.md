## Scripture

Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.  For you will be treated as you
treat others. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will
be judged.

And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye[c] when you have a log in your
own?  How can you think of saying to your friend,[d] 'Let me help you get rid of
that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? 

Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well
enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye.

Don't waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don't throw your pearls to
pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.

Matthew 7:1


## Prayer

It is so easy to criticize and judge others while I ignore the glaring problems
in my life.  Teach me to have an attitude of grace and generosity toward others.
Let my interactions be filled with empathy and compassion.  Empathy to know how
others are feeling - Compassion to care.
