# Daily Meditation - May 14

## Scripture

Not everyone who calls out to me, 'Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of 
Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will  enter.
On  judgment day many will say to me, 'Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your 
name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in  your
name.'  But I will reply, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break
God's laws.' 

Matthew 7:21


## Prayer

It is not the things that I do that make me close to you, but the desire that
I have to be with you.  Give me pure motives to pursue you for the joy of 
relationship - not just for the benefits that you give me.
