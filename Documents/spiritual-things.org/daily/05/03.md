# Daily Meditation - May 3

## Scripture

I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now
that you belong to Christ Jesus.  Through him, God has enriched your church in
every way â€” with all of your eloquent words and all of your knowledge.  This
confirms that what I told you about Christ is true.  

Now you have every
spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus
Christ.  He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all
blame on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns.    God  will do this, for
he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited  you into partnership with
his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

1 Co 1:4


## Prayer

We have been invited into a partnership with the you.  This boggles my mind!
You have provided everything that we need to to live a successful life, but
the big challenge is to stay connected to you.  There is no way we can branch
out on our own and initiate activities that you did not prompt and be at
peace.  Keep me on the narrow path that leads to life.
