# Daily Meditation - May 8

## Scripture

Look  here, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town  and
will stay there a year. We will do business there and make a  profit.”  How  do
you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the  morning
fog—it's here a little while, then it's gone.  

What you ought to say is, "If the Lord wants us to, we will live and do this or
that.”  Otherwise you are boasting about your own pretentious plans, and all
such boasting is evil. Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do and then
not do it.

James 4:13


## Prayer

I make many plans without really considering if this is your will for me.
Remind me to hold everything in my life with an open hand and not a closed
fist.  This is a very different posture that has profound consequences for
how I experience life.  I desire to be totally yielded to your plans for me.
