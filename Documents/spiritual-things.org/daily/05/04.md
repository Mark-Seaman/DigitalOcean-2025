# Daily Meditation - May 4

## Scripture

And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.  Dear  friends,
I am not writing a new commandment for you; rather it is an  old one you have
had from the very beginning. This old commandment — to  love one another — is
the same message you heard before.  Yet  it is also new. Jesus lived the truth
of this commandment, and you also  are living it. For the darkness is
disappearing, and the true light is  already shining.

If anyone claims, "I am living in the light,” but hates a fellow believer, that
person is still living in darkness.  Anyone who loves a fellow believer[b] is
living in the light and does not cause others to stumble.  But  anyone who hates
a fellow believer is still living and walking in  darkness. Such a person does
not know the way to go, having been blinded  by the darkness.

1 Jn 2:3


## Prayer

Love is the truest test of spiritual and emotional maturity. Without love our
lives are meaningless and devoid of your presence.  Shine your light on my
innermost being and teach me to love more deeply.
