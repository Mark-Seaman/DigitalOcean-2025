## Scripture

For the Lord your God is living among you.
He is a mighty savior.
He will take delight in you with gladness.
With his love, he will calm all your fears.
He will rejoice over you with joyful songs.

Zephaniah 3:17


## Prayer

Lord, we long to see your presence.  Your kingdom is what brings life and 
meaning to our lives.  Make us more aware of your presence.  Each place
we go, we want to be with you.
