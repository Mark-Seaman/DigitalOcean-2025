# Daily Meditation - May 1

## Scripture

My  dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin. But  if
anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the  Father. He
is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous. He himself is the sacrifice
that atones for our sins â€” and not only our sins but the sins of all the world.

1 John 2:1


## Prayer

Thank you for reconciling us to yourself even though we were far from you.  You 
redeem all things.  I see this daily. You bring life and light to all things.
