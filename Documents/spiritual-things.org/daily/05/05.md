# Daily Meditation - May 5

## Scripture

I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now
that you belong to Christ Jesus. 

Through him, God has enriched your church in every way â€” with all of your eloquent
words and all of your knowledge. 

This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true. 

Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of
our Lord Jesus Christ. 

He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on
the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns. 

God  will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited 
you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

1 Co 1:4


## Prayer

True strength comes from you.  We need the gifts that you give us to thrive in
this world.  You have set us on a path that ultimately brings us 
freedom.  Let this call to partnership result in a faithful walk that teaches
me more about your kingdom.
