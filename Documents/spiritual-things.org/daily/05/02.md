# Daily Meditation - May 2

## Scripture

If someone claims, "I know God,” but doesn't obey God's commandments, that
person is a liar and is not living in the truth. But those who obey God's word
truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in
him. Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.

If anyone claims, "I am living in the light,” but hates a fellow believer, that person is still living in darkness. 


1 John 2:4


## Prayer

Let me have integrity in all that I do.  Allow me to see my actions and behavior
as you do.  Shine your light on my basic attitudes and innate reactions.  Give
me an awareness of how my life affects those around me.
