## Scripture

If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive
you. But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your
sins. 

Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how often should I forgive someone who
sins against me? Seven times?” "No, not seven times,” Jesus replied, "but
seventy times seven!

My heavenly Father will release and heal you if you forgive your 
brothers and sisters from your heart.

Matthew 6:14, 18:21


## Prayer

Forgiveness can be such a difficult thing for me.  I want to hold on to the
hurts and look for opportunities to retaliate.  But your truth is clear on
this subject.  I will never be free from the hurt until I work through the
forgiveness.
