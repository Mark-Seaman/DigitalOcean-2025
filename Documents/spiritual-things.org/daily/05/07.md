# Daily Meditation - May 7

## Scripture

When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom.
Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit's words to
explain spiritual truths. But people who aren't spiritual can't receive these
truths from God's Spirit. 

It all sounds foolish to them and they can't
understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit
means. Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves
cannot be evaluated by others.

1 Co 2:13


## Prayer

Give me the ability to see the truths that I naturally resist.  Teach me to
look intently with courage at the hard truths that govern our world.  Cause me
to love justice and compassion the way that you do.

Help me to stand up against exploitation and brutality even when I share the
same interests as the privileged class causing the suffering.  Give me courage
to take action to make the world kinder for all.
