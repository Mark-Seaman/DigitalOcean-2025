# Daily Meditation - January 24

## Scripture

How can a young person stay pure? By obeying your word.

I have tried hard to find you â€” don't let me wander from your commands.

I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.

I praise you, O Lord; teach me your decrees.

I have recited aloud all the regulations you have given us.

I have rejoiced in your laws as much as in riches.

I will study your commandments and reflect on your ways.

I will delight in your decrees and not forget your word.

Psalm 119:9


## Prayer

Lord, let my life be saturated with your presence.  Let goodness flow from me
to others.  Build my thoughts on a sound foundation of truth, that can come
only from you. Though many may fall away to pursue their own agendas keep me
on the narrow path of your kingdom.  Let your words resonate within me and be
my guide.  Transform me completely so that I show the fruit of your Spirit in
every area of my life.
