# Daily Meditation - January 15

## Scripture

And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to
follow him.  Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on
him.

Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will
overflow with thankfulness.

Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense
that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers of this world,
rather than from Christ.

But my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work
assigned me by the Lord Jesus - the work of telling others the Good News about
the wonderful grace of God.

Co 2:6, Ac 20:24


## Prayer

There are many philosophies that beckon me away from your plan for my life.
Help me to be wholehearted in my pursuit of the things that truly matter.
Let me be constantly aware of the purpose that you have laid before me. 
Remind me of your truths and give me a pure and honest heart to follow you.
I cannot do it without your strength.
