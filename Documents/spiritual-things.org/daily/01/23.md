# Daily Meditation - January 23

## Scripture

God's promise of entering his rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with
fear that some of you might fail to experience it.  For this good news—that God
has prepared this rest—has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it
did them no good because they didn't share the faith of those who listened to
God.

For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said,  "They
will never enter my place of rest", even though this rest has been ready since
he made the world.  

So God's rest is there for people to enter, but those who first heard this good
news failed to enter because they disobeyed God.  So God set another time for
entering his rest, and that time is today.

So there is a special rest  still waiting for the people of God.  For all who
have entered into God's rest have rested from their labors, just as God did
after creating the world.  So let us do our best to enter that rest. But if we
disobey God, we will fall.


## Prayer

You have created a place of refuge and peace for me in your presence.  In that
quiet place alone with you I find everything I need. Forgive me for all the 
times I have run from your refuge in order to pursue my own will and agenda.
Thank you that special place of peace is always waiting for me.  Make me more
aware of this reality so that I will not fail to enter your rest.
