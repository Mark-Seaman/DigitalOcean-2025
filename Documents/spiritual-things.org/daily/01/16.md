# Daily Meditation - January 16

## Scripture

Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It
does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of
being wronged. 

It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the
truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and
endures through every circumstance.

Good comes to those who lend money generously and conduct their business fairly.

1 Co 13:4, Ps 112:5


## Prayer

I confess that as I read about true love I feel my own shortfall. Each of 
these phrases bring to memory times when I have not acted as you would.  
Forgive me for not loving like you. 

At the same time, I rejoice to reflect on the ways that your love is demonstrated
in my life.  Each day becomes an opportunity to bring your kingdom to others.
But for this to happen your authority must start in my life.  Make me a
truer reflection of your love.
