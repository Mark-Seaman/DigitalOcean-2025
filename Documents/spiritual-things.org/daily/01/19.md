# Daily Meditation - January 19

## Scripture

But don't just listen to Gods word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are
only fooling yourselves. For if you listen to the word and don't obey, it is
like glancing at your face in a mirror. 

You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like. But if you look
carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says
and don't forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.

Anyone who starts plowing and keeps looking back, isn't worth a thing to God's
Kingdom. Apart from Me you can do nothing.

Ja 1:22, Lk 9:62, Jn 15:5


## Prayer

It is so easy for me to hear your words of wisdom and yet remain utterly 
unchanged. I desire to be changed and transformed by your presence in my life.
In good times and bad I want to keep my eyes focused on you and so fulfill the
plans that you have for my life.
