# Daily Meditation - January 27

## Scripture

Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's
eyes or powerful or wealthy when God called you.Instead, God chose things
the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. 

And
he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful. God chose
things despised by the world,[h] things counted as nothing at all, and used them
to bring to nothing what the world considers important.

I have a lot more to say about this, but it is hard to get it across to you
since you've picked up this bad habit of not listening. By this time you ought
to be teachers yourselves, yet here I find you need someone to sit down with you
and go over the basics on God again, starting from square oneâ€”baby's milk, when
you should have been on solid food long ago! 

Milk is for beginners,
inexperienced in God's ways; solid food is for the mature, who have some
practice in telling right from wrong.

1 Co 1:27, Heb 5:12


## Prayer

I confess that my thoughts are not your thoughts and at my most clever I am
still a beginner.  Help me to have an appropriate awareness of my limited
understanding of truth.  Give me the heart of a student to sit at the feet of
the Master and learn.  Help me to be humble and embrace the things that you 
teach me and apply them to my life.
