# Daily Meditation - January 8

## Scripture

You are controlled by the Spirit, not sin, if you have the Spirit of  God living
in you. Remember that those who do not have Christ living in them do not belong
to him at all. Christ lives in you, so even though sin will cause your body to
die, the Spirit makes you right with God resulting in life. 

God's Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. Just as God raised
Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your physical bodies by his Spirit
living in you.
 
My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but
Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of
God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

Ro 8:9,  Ga 2:20


## Prayer

Lord make this a reality in my life.  Help me to die to the old ways of thinking
which oppose your authority.  I confess that there are areas of my life where sin
does rule.  I have harmful thinking patterns, destructive ways of relating to
others, and inappropriate behaviors.

But I also am drawn to the new life I find in your presence.   You are
constantly inviting me to experience the resurrected life and your
resurrection power.  Let this be the focus of my attention and affection today.
