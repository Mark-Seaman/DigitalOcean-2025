# Daily Meditation - January 1

## Scripture

And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and 
precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share 
his divine nature and escape the world's corruption caused by human desires.

But with eager hope, the creation looks forward to the day when it  
will join God's children in glorious freedom from death and decay. 
For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of 
childbirth right up to the present time.

2 Pe 1:4, Ro 8:20


## Prayer

Help me to wait patiently for your presence in my life.  Even as 
this world is fallen into decay and death your Spirit still moves 
to bring life.  Let me be conscious of your ongoing work within 
this world.  Make me aware of the work that you 
are doing in me and through me to bring your redemption.
