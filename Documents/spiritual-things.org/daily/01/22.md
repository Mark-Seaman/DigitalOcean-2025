# Daily Meditation - January 22

## Scripture

For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don't
use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to
serve one another in love.  

And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature
desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not
free to carry out your good intentions.

But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,  gentleness, and self-control. There
is no law against these things!

Ga 5


## Prayer

God, I acknowledge this conflict that rages within me.  Help me to overcome my
base human nature in order to yield fully to you.  Transform me from within to
be the person that you want me to be.  Let your fruit be the most obvious feature
that others see.  Fill me with your presence and change me from the inside.
