# Daily Meditation - January 11

## Scripture

Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you
will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  For everyone
who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the
door will be opened.

I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with
inner strength through his Spirit.  Then Christ will make his home in your
hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God's love and keep
you strong.

Mat 7:7,  Ep 3:16


## Prayer

I acknowledge that everything good in my life is a gift from you.
You meet all of my true needs: physical, safety and security, belonging and
social relationships, identity, and a purpose for living. Beyond that you also
give me many of my desires.  I just want to pause and say thank you for all
that you have done for me.
