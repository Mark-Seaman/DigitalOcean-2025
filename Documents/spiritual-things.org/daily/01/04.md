# Daily Meditation - January 4

## Scripture

Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them; pray that God will bless them. Be happy with those who are happy, and
weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with each other.

Don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!
Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable. Do all that you can
to live in peace with everyone. When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring the weak
to Christ. Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing everything I can to save some. I do everything to
spread the Good News and share in its blessings.

Ro 12:14, I Co 9:22


## Prayer

Lord, show me my relationships. Help me to love those who hurt me. Mend the broken trust and bring your supernatural
healing. Cause me to live a life of reconciliation and redemption. I repent of my desire to lash out in revenge for
those who have done bad things to me and my desire to be right. I submit humbly to your will and ask that you would
transform my relationships by your grace. Let me live a life that brings honor and glory to you.
