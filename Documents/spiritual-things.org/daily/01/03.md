# Daily Meditation - January 3

## Scripture

Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults
because of your love. Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves
together with peace.

Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say,
"I will take revenge; I will pay them back", says the Lord. Instead, if your enemies are hungry,
feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning
coals of shame on their heads. Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.

Ep 4:2, Ro 12:19


## Prayer

Lord, help me see the people in my life the way that you see them. I desire to relinquish my need to
control others. Make me a blessing to all those around me. Cause me to think about encouragement
rather than criticism. Show me the opportunities that you have invited me into, for serving others.
I repent of my need to control the behavior, beliefs, and feelings of others. Make me more like
you.
