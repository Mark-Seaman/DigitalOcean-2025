# Daily Meditation - January 13

## Scripture

And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself  through
Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to  him.  For God
was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer  counting people's
sins against them. 

And he gave us this wonderful  message of reconciliation.  So
we are Christ's ambassadors; God is  making his appeal through us. We speak for
Christ when we plead, "Come  back to God!"

For, There is one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity-the
man Christ Jesus. He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the
message God gave to the world at just the right time.

2 Co 5:18, 1 Ti 2:5


## Prayer

Let my life be a an open book, bringing hope to those who are far from you.
Give me eyes to see with clarity and a voice to speak love and truth to others.
Make me a true ambassador of your wonderful kingdom.   Point others back to
the path of reconciliation as a result of my life.  Let my legacy bring healing
and redemption to others.
