# Daily Meditation - January 9

## Scripture

So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we
thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him
now!  This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The
old life is gone; a new life has begun!
 
Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No one-for God  himself has
given us right standing with himself. Who then will condemn  us? No one-for
Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us,  and he is sitting in
the place of honor at God's right hand, pleading  for us.

 2Co 5:16, Ro 8:33


## Prayer

I confess that I often look at others and myself through a selfish lens.  This
leads me to be critical and judgmental.  Help me to see people as you see them.
Let me extend love and forgiveness to all of those I come in contact with.

Give me your perspective.  Transform my worldview from one that is shaped by my
cultural values to that shaped by a desire to be like you.  Work in my heart to
soften the hard places and confront the sinful attitudes that persist.
