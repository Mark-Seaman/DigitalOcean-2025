# Daily Meditation - January 30

## Scripture

And so, dear brothers and sisters, I plead with you to give your bodies to God
because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice â€”
the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him. Don't
copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a
new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will
for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.

Ro 12:1


## Prayer

Transform me from the inside out.  Give me a heart that is soft and pliable.
Let my worship be complete and convert my thinking to be pleasing to you.
Give me passions that are aligned with your will.
