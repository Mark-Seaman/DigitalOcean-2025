# Daily Meditation - January 2

## Scripture

What can we bring to the Lord? Should we bring him burnt offerings? Should we bow before God Most High with offerings of
yearling calves? Should we offer him thousands of rams and ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Should we sacrifice our
firstborn children to pay for our sins?

No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good, and this is what he requires of you: to do what is right, to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.

What is more pleasing to the Lord: your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice? Listen!
Obedience is better than sacrifice, and submission is better than offering the fat of rams. Rebellion is as sinful as
witchcraft, and stubbornness as bad as worshiping idols. So because you have rejected the command of the Lord, he has
rejected you as king.

Micah 6:6, I Sa 15:21


## Prayer

Forgive me of my willingness to offer sacrifices in place of obedience. Open my eyes to the reality of this in my life.
Show me what justice, compassion, and humility truly look like. Give me a willing heart to walk the narrow path. Reveal
your truth about the dangers of being drawn into exploitation for my own gain, indifference for the suffering of others,
and the belief that I am better that those around me. I repent from these attitudes and beliefs that constantly threaten
to consume my life.
