# Daily Meditation - January 21

## Scripture

Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for
each other's faults because of your love. Make every effort to keep yourselves
united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace.

So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
Don't give offense to Jews or Gentiles or the church of God. I, too, try to
please everyone in everything I do. 

I don't just do what is best for me; I do what is best for others so that many
may be saved. And you should imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.

We who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things
like this. We must not just please ourselves.


Ep 4:2, 1 Co 10:31, Ro 15:1


## Prayer

Lord, help me to connect with others.  Let me share your life with them.
Make me conscious of the impact I have on those around me.  Give me the humility to
not just please myself but to take into account what others need.  Make me an
example, embodying the virtues of your Spirit.
