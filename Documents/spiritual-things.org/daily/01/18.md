# Daily Meditation - January 18

## Scripture

Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the
world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. For the world offers only
a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in
our achievements and possessions. 

These are not from the Father, but are from
this world.
If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall.

The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And
God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand.
When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure.

1 John 2:15,  1 Co 10:12


## Prayer

Our culture teaches us to value things that are different from what you truly
value. Our human nature naturally leads us to seek pleasure and the pursuit of wealth 
power. You have identified this path that leads to our destruction. Your path
leading to life lies through dieing to our own desires.

Help me to see this view of reality when everything around me calls for the
exaltation of self. I welcome your authority in my life and acknowledge that
you have a right to rule over me.
