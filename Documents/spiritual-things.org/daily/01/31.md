# Daily Meditation - January 31

## Scripture

Then Peter stepped forward with the eleven other apostles and shouted to the
crowd, "Listen carefully, all of you, fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem!
People of Israel, listen! God publicly endorsed Jesus the Nazarene by doing
powerful miracles, wonders, and signs through him, as you well know. But God
knew what would happen, and his prearranged plan was carried out when Jesus was
betrayed. With the help of lawless Gentiles, you nailed him to a cross and
killed him. But God released him from the horrors of death and raised him back
to life, for death could not keep him in its grip.”

"So let everyone in Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus, whom
you crucified, to be both Lord and Messiah!” Peter's words pierced their
hearts, and they said to him and to the other apostles, "Brothers, what should
we do?”

Act 2:14


## Prayer

Lord, give me the clarity and boldness that Peter demonstrated on this day.
Help me to understand how the events in my life fit into the larger story of
your mercy and grace for humanity.
