# Daily Meditation - January 12

## Scripture

Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the
world, you do not have the love of the Father in you. For the world offers only
a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in
our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from
this world.

And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious
promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and
escape the world's corruption caused by human desires.

1 Jn 2:15,  2Pe 1:4


## Prayer

Lord, I desire your kingdom and your presence in my life.  But I also struggle
with the constant pull of my humanity.  Physical pleasure, achievements, and 
possessions all would draw me away from you and lead me down a dark path.
My culture and false personal identity threaten to create an illusion of following
you and justify being selfish.  Forgive me when I lose my way and bring me
back quickly onto the path of life.
