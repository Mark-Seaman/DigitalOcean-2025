# Daily Meditation - January 29

## Scripture

We should love one another. If we love our brothers and sisters who are
believers, it proves that we have passed from death to life. But a person who has
no love is still dead.  

If anyone claims, "I am living in the light,‚Äù but hates a fellow believer, that
person is still living in darkness.  Anyone who loves a fellow believer is living
in the light and does not cause others to stumble. But anyone who hates a fellow
believer is still living and walking in darkness. Such a person does not know
the way to go, having been blinded by the darkness. 

1Jn 3:11, 1Jn 2:9

## Prayer

Show me what true love looks like.  Keep me from any form of self-delusion.
Help me to be truly compassionate and seek the welfare of others more than my
own.  Give me eyes to see those who suffer and a willingness to bring them
relief.
