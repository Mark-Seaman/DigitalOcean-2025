# Daily Meditation - January 28

## Scripture

And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect. So we will not be afraid on
the day of judgment, but we can face him with confidence because we live like
Jesus here in this world.

Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear. If we are
afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows that we have not fully
experienced his perfect love. 

We love each other because he loved us first. This is the message you have heard
from the beginning: We should love one another.  If we love our brothers and
sisters who are believers, it proves that we have passed from death to life. But
a person who has no love is still dead.  

1 Jn 4:17, 1 Jn 3:11


## Prayer

Love is the true test of our faith.  Give me the grace to love like you love.
Help me to overcome the fear that is a part of my interactions with others.
For this fear blocks your love.  Let your love be a sign of you consistent 
work within me and evidence of passing from death to life.
