# Daily Meditation - January 14

## Scripture

Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles come your way, consider it an
opportunity for great joy. For you know that when your faith is tested, your
endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully
developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.

In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God's promises. Supplement
your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence
with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient
endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly
affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone. 

The more you grow
like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ.

Ja 1:2, 2 Pe 1:5


## Prayer

I confess that this is not my natural response.  Yet as I look back over my
life I can clearly see how difficulties have been an essential part of my 
growth.  Help me to view my current struggles with an eternal eye. I need to 
clearly see the progression of moral and emotional development.  Only then
can I truly be at peace in the midst of the storm.  Let me quietly submit to
your will on the way to discovering true maturity.
