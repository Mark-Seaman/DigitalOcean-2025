# Daily Meditation - January 10

## Scripture

But blessed are those who trust in the Lord and have made the Lord their
hope and confidence. They are like trees planted along a riverbank, with
roots that reach deep into the water. Such trees are not bothered by the heat   
or worried by long months of drought. Their leaves stay green, and they
never stop producing fruit. 

Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand
around with sinners, or join in with mockers.
But they delight in the law of the Lord, meditating on it day and night.

They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season.
Their leaves never wither, and they prosper in all they do.

Jer 17:7, Ps 1:1


## Prayer

Make me like a tree planted along the riverbank.  Let me draw constant nourishment
from your presence. Help me to survive the long droughts that are inevitable.  I
desire to turn away from the harmful advice of others that would lead me into
cynicism and despair.  I choose a different path from my culture of selfishness.


Make me like a tree planted along the riverbank. Let me continue to bear fruit
even when things get very dark.  I recognize that true fruit comes from healthy
plants being in a good place.  No amount of self-effort can make the fruit,
but it is a natural (or supernatural) result of staying connected to the source
of life.
