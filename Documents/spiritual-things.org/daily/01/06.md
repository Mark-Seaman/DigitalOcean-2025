# Daily Meditation - January 6

## Scripture

Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with each other. Never pay back evil
with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable.

Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone. Live in harmony with each other. Don't be too proud to enjoy the
company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!
Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God.

I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for
them. Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by
godliness and dignity.

Ro 12:15, 1Ti 2:1


## Prayer

Help me see people the way that you see them. Change my heart from one of criticism, judgment, and control, to one of
compassion for those who suffer. Let me see my own brokenness. Only then can I have mercy for those around me. I desire
to see your kingdom come in every area of life and want to see you rule extend to those in authority. This is how we
will experience your redemption and harmony in our broken world. Let your kingdom come on earth.
