# Daily Meditation - January 25

## Scripture

For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as
yourself.‚Äù But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out!
Beware of destroying one another.

So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won't be doing what
your sinful nature craves.  The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just
the opposite of what the Spirit wants. 

If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love
those who love them. And if you do good to those who are good to you, what
credit is that to you? Even sinners do that.  Be merciful, just as your Father
is merciful.
 
Ga 5:14, Luke 6:32


## Prayer

I confess that I love myself far more than I do those around me.  It is hard
for me to even imagine it being different. Yet I know that your Spirit is 
transforming me in ways I can't fully understand. You beckon me forward into
a place unknown. There is such a huge gap between your ways of thinking and my
own. I welcome your work and ask that you would change me from the inside out
to look more like you.  Help to love the way that you love.
