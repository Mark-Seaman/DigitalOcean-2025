# Daily Meditation - January 7

## Scripture

When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring the weak to Christ.
Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing everything I can to save some. I do
everything to spread the Good News and share in its blessings. Don't you realize that in a race
everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win!

All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but
we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing. I
discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after
preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.

But my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord
Jesus - the work of telling others the Good News about the wonderful grace of God.

2Co 5:16 Ac 20:24

## Prayer

Help me clearly see your purpose for my life.  Let me focus on bringing redemption to others. I
want to run my race to its completion in submission to your authority. Show me when I am not loving
the way that you love and living the way that you live. Reveal the selfishness within me that would
pull me away from you.
