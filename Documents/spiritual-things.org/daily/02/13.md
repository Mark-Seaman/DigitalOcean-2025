# Daily Meditation - February 13

## Scripture

The council then threatened them further, but they finally let them go because
they didn't know how to punish them without starting a riot. For everyone was
praising God for this miraculous signâ€”the healing of a man who had been lame for
more than forty years. 

As soon as they were freed, Peter and John returned to the other believers and
told them what the leading priests and elders had said. When they heard the
report, all the believers lifted their voices together in prayer to God.After
this prayer, the meeting place shook, and they were all filled with the Holy
Spirit. Then they preached the word of God with boldness.

Acts 4:21


## Prayer

Continued opposition and threats are the expected result of the evil that is at
work in our world.  You told us that men hate the light because they love
darkness. Let me be a beacon the darkness and a voice of hope in times of
despair.
