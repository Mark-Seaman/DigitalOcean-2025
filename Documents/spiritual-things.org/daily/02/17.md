# Daily Meditation - February 17

## Scripture

In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So
if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as
God has given you. If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a
teacher, teach well. If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it
is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the
responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others,
do it gladly. 

Ro 12:6


## Prayer

You have given each of us unique personalities and fit us into a community with 
others.  Help me to use what makes me different to benefit others.  Show me the
distinct ways that I can fully use what makes me special. Give me the grace to
both give and receive your love from others.
