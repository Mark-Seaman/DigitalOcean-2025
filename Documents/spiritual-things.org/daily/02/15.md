# Daily Meditation - February 15

## Scripture

Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It
does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of
being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the
truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and
endures through every circumstance.

If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could
boast about it; but if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing.
All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything
completely, just as God now knows me completely.

1 Co 13:4


## Prayer

Help me to love others with complete integrity.  Make me a demonstrations of 
the true love that you have for all of us.  Create within me a pure heart.
