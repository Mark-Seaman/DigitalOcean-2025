# Daily Meditation - February 21

## Scripture

I am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever
believe in me through their message. I  pray that they will all be one, just
as you and I are oneâ€”as you are in  me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be
in us so that the world  will believe you sent me. 

I have given them the
glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one. I  am in them and you
are in me. May they experience such perfect unity  that the world will know that
you sent me and that you love them as much  as you love me.

Jn 17:20


## Prayer

Unity of mind, heart, and purpose is one of the most difficult things to 
achieve.  We so easily break into factions and and seek to dominate and control
one another.  Let today be a turning point for me begin seeing others as you
see them.  Give me a spirit of unity toward all those who seek to follow you
and a spirit of reconciliation for those who are far from you.
