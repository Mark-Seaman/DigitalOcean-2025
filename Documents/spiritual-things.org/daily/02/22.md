# Daily Meditation - February 22

## Scripture

We will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown
about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try
to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth. Instead, we will
speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is
the head of his body, the church. 

Ep 4:14


## Prayer

Help me to grow in my thinking.  There are many forces that would distract and
sidetrack your work in my life. Use those around me to speak your truth and
allow me to have influence and impact on others.  Let this be a foundation
of stability in the chaos of our world.
