# Daily Meditation - February 9

## Scripture

So where  does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world's 
brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish. Since 
God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through  human
wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who  believe.   

It is foolish to those who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to those
who seek human wisdom.   So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews
are offended and the Gentiles say it's all nonsense.

But to those called by God to salvation, Christ is the power of God and the
wisdom of God. This  foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human
plans, and God's  weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength.

1 Co 1:20


## Prayer

There are common philosophies that appear to be true but are directly opposed
to your authority. And the wisdom of your kingdom appears to be foolish until
we see its truth. Help me to distinguish the difference between truth and lies,
and give me clarity in telling others.
