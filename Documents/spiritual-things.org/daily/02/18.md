# Daily Meditation - February 18

## Scripture

The body has many different parts, not just one part. If the foot says, "I
am not a part of the body because I am not a hand,” that does not make it any
less a part of the body. And if the ear says, "I am not part of the body because
I am not an eye,” would that make it any less a part of the body? If the whole
body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how
would you smell anything? 

But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants
it. How strange a body would be if it had only one part! Yes, there are many
parts, but only one body. The eye can never say to the hand, "I don't need you.”
The head can't say to the feet, "I don't need you.” 

1 Co 12:12


## Prayer

Help me to understand and appreciate the delicate nature of how we all fit 
together.  Show me my unique calling to serve others. Let me grasp how 
incomplete my life would be without the interaction with other people.  Even
the friction I feel has a useful purpose in transforming me into your likeness.
