# Daily Meditation - February 24

## Scripture

I am the true grapevine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch
of mine that doesn't produce fruit, and he prunes the branches that do bear
fruit so they will produce even more. You have already been pruned and purified
by the message I have given you. Remain in me, and I will remain in you. For a
branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be
fruitful unless you remain in me.

Yes,  I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in 
them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.  Anyone 
who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and  withers.
Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned.  But if you remain in me
and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be
granted!  When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings
great glory to my Father.

John 15:1


## Prayer

I am fully dependent on you for every aspect of my life.  There is really 
nothing that I can do on my own.
Forgive me for not seeing this and attempting to force my will on the world
around me.
