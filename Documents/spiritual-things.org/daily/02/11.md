# Daily Meditation - February 11

## Scripture

But don't just listen to God's word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you
are only fooling yourselves. For if you listen to the word and don't obey, it is
like glancing at your face in a mirror. You see yourself, walk away, and forget
what you look like. But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you
free, and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard, then God will
bless you for doing it.

Ja 1:22


## Prayer

Help me to have integrity in my life.  Bring a consistency between what I say,
do, thing and feel.  Let all the parts of my character work together to reveal
your transforming work within.  Steer me away from the eventual disintegration
that follows the lack of integrity within.
