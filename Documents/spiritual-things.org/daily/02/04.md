# Daily Meditation - February 4

## Scripture

Don't just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold
tightly to what is good. Love each other with genuine affection, and take
delight in honoring each other. Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord
enthusiastically. Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep
on praying. When God's people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be
eager to practice hospitality. 

Ro 12:9


## Prayer

I desire to follow you with my whole heart.  At the same time, I must admit that
there is also a part of me that only seeks to please myself.
Give me a passion for the things that you are passionate about and the integrity
to walk it out in my life.
