# Daily Meditation - February 10

## Scripture

You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry. Human
anger does not produce the righteousness God desires. So get rid of all the
filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the word God has planted in your
hearts, for it has the power to save your souls.

If you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue, you are fooling
yourself, and your religion is worthless. Pure and genuine religion in the sight
of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and
refusing to let the world corrupt you.

Ja 1:19


## Prayer

I confess that I am much more interested in speaking me opinion that I am in
listening and understanding the viewpoints of others.  Forgive my blindness in
this area and help me to be more conscious of how I interact with others.
