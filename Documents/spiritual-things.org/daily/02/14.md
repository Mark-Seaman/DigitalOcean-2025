# Daily Meditation - February 14

## Scripture

Three things will last forever — faith, hope, and love — and the greatest of these
is love. This is real love — not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent
his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.

1 Co 13:13, 1 Jn 4:10


## Prayer

True love can only be known by experiencing it. I can never express your love
to others unless I have fully received it myself.  Help me bask in the warm
light of your love so that I have something to give away to others.
