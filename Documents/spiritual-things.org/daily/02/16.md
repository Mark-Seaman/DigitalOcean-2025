# Daily Meditation - February 16

## Scripture

Because of the privilege and authority God has given me, I give each of you this
warning: Don't think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your
evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us.
Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function, so it
is with Christ's body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each
other. 

Suppose someone comes into your meeting dressed in fancy clothes and
expensive jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in dirty
clothes. If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but
you say to the poor one, "You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor” —
well, doesn't this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil
motives?

Ro 12:3, Ja 2:2


## Prayer

How we view and treat others is a direct reflection  of our relationship with
you.   Lord, grow me in maturity.  Let me show that in how I relate to others
that you have placed in my life.
