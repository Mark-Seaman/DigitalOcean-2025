# Daily Meditation - February 5

## Scripture

If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt
tax collectors do that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you
different from anyone else? Even pagans do that.

Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them; pray that God will bless them.
Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony
with each other. Don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And
don't think you know it all! 

"You have heard the law that says, 'Love your neighbor' and hate your enemy. But
I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! In that way, you
will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his
sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the
unjust alike. 

Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can
see you are honorable. Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone. 

Ro 12:14, Mat 5:43


## Prayer

Lord, give me a love that exceeds reciprocity.  Help me to go beyond simple
enlightened self-interest.  I want to learn to love the way that you love and 
see people the way that you do.  Let me give your love to those that can never
pay me back.
