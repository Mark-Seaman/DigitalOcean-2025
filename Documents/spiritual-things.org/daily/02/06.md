# Daily Meditation - February 6

## Scripture

There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source
of them all. There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord.
God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of
us. A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.

1 Co 12:4


## Prayer

You give us gifts to strengthen our lives together. These are an expression
of your love for us that is shared with one another. We are all meant to be 
part of the delivery and receivers of these amazing gifts.
