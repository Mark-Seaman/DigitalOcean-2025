# Daily Meditation - February 23

## Scripture

He makes the whole body fit together
perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts
grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love. 

To one person
the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another the same Spirit
gives a message of special knowledge. The same Spirit gives great faith to
another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing. 
It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these
gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have. 


Ep 4:16, 1 Co 12:8


## Prayer

You have placed me into a community of people that want to follow you. You have 
also given us gifts that are delivered through the actions of other people.
I can only receive those blessings by being connected with others.  Help me to
be open and vulnerable.
