# Daily Meditation - February 8

## Scripture

Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children.
Live a life filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved us and
offered himself as a sacrifice for us, a pleasing aroma to God.

Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all
types of evil behavior. Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving
one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.

Ep 5:8, Ep 4:31


## Prayer

May my behavior be a demonstration of my commitment to you.  Let my life be
an open book that can be read by all.  Help me to show others what it means
to be transformed.
