# Daily Meditation - February 3

## Scripture

And all the believers were meeting regularly at the Temple in the area known as
Solomon's Colonnade. All the believers were united in heart and mind. 

And they felt that what they owned was not their own, so they shared everything
they had. There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or
houses would sell them and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in
need.

The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and
God's great blessing was upon them all.  The apostles were performing many
miraculous signs and wonders among the people.


Act 4:32


## Prayer

Lord, we pray for a spirit of unity in these divisive times.  May our 
understanding of your grace in our lives give us the humility to serve one
another.  Let care and concern become our defining characteristic.
