# Daily Meditation - February 25

## Scripture

But now let me show you a way of life that is best of all.
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

Stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbors the truth, for we are all parts
of the same body. 

And "don't sin by letting anger control you.‚Äù Don't let the
sun go down while you are still angry, for anger gives a foothold to the devil. 

If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard work,
and then give generously to others in need. 

Don't use foul or abusive language.
Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an
encouragement to those who hear them. 

1 Co 12:31, Ep 4:25


## Prayer

It is so easy for me to feel spiritual while clinging to a corrupt lifestyle.
Help me to be brutally honest with the things that are unresolved in my life.
I want to live free of addiction and self-deception.  I want to be transformed
to the core of being.  Make me more like you.
