# Daily Meditation - February 19

## Scripture

If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honored,
all the parts are glad.  Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those
who weep. Live in harmony with each other. Don't be too proud to enjoy the
company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!

Some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are
actually the most necessary. And the parts we regard as less honorable are those
we clothe with the greatest care. So we carefully protect those parts that
should not be seen, while the more honorable parts do not require this special
care. So God has put the body together such that extra honor and care are given
to those parts that have less dignity. This makes for harmony among the members,
so that all the members care for each other. 

1 Co 12:22, Ro 12:15


## Prayer

Lord, help me to be truly connected to others and to treat them with care.
Transform my attitudes about what it means to be in community. Cause me to be
more open to the pain of others and to be less focused on my own pain.
