# Daily Meditation - February 26

## Scripture

With the Lord's authority I say this: Live no longer as unbelievers do, for
they are hopelessly confused. Their minds are full of darkness; they wander far
from the life God gives because they have closed their minds and hardened their
hearts against him. They have no sense of shame. They live for lustful pleasure
and eagerly practice every kind of impurity.

Ep 4:17


## Prayer

Lord, sometimes I do feel hopelessly confused and like I have a mind full of
darkness.  I ask that you would open my mind and soften my heart. Let me
experience the full and overflowing life that is found in your presence.
