# Daily Meditation - February 28

## Scripture

Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other; let us show the
truth by our actions.

This is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one
another. 

And this is his commandment: We must believe in Jesus
Christ and love one another, just as he commanded us.

1 John 3


## Prayer

Love is the true measure of my spirituality.  Forgive me for neglecting to
actually love the people that you have put in my life.  Bring your honesty
and purity to all of my relationships.  Help me to see people the way that
you see them.
