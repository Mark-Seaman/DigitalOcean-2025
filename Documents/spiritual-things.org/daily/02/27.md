# Daily Meditation - February 27

## Scripture

Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse their sins, for the anger of God will
fall on all who disobey him. Don't participate in the things these people do.
For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So
live as people of light! For this light within you produces only what is good
and right and true. 

Ep 5:6


## Prayer

Help me to live a life characterized by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Each of these virtues
has a matching element of darkness.  Let your light shine in me so that it 
removes the darkness within my heart.  For it is the darkness inside that leads
me into sinful behaviors.
