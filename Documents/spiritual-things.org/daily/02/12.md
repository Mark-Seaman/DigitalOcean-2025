# Daily Meditation - February 12

## Scripture

"What should we do with these men?” they asked each other. "We can't deny that
they have performed a miraculous sign, and everybody in Jerusalem knows about
it. But to keep them from spreading their propaganda any further, we must warn
them not to speak to anyone in Jesus' name again.” So they called the apostles
back in and commanded them never again to speak or teach in the name of Jesus. 

But Peter and John replied, "Do you think God wants us to obey you rather than
him? We cannot stop telling about everything we have seen and heard.” 

Acts 4:16


## Prayer

We always have a choice when we feel that our safety is threathened. There is
no assurance what the outcome will be if we stand up for what we feel is right.
Give me the courage to face the opposition when the stakes are high and my
welfare is at risk.
