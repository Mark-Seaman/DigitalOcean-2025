# Daily Meditation - February 20

## Scripture

The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. So it
is with the body of Christ. Some of us are Jews, some are Gentiles, some are
slaves, and some are free. But we have all been baptized into one body by one
Spirit, and we all share the same Spirit.

1Co 12:12


## Prayer

Each person that I meet has unique gifts from your presence. Help me to embrace
them as I would receive you into my life.  Break down the divisions in my mind
that would keep me isolated from others: Gender, Race, Culture, Class, and
Age.
