# Daily Meditation - February 01

## Scripture

During the forty days after his crucifixion, Jesus appeared to the apostles from
time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And
he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.

Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, "Do not leave Jerusalem
until the Father sends you the gift he promised, as I told you before. John
baptized with water, but in just a few days you will be baptized with the Holy
Spirit.‚Äù 

On the day of Pentecost all the believers were meeting together in one place.
Suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm,
and it filled the house where they were sitting. Then, what looked like flames
or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them. And everyone present
was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages, as the
Holy Spirit gave them this ability.

Acts 1:3, 2:2


## Prayer

We need your Spirit to lead us, guide us, and teach us your truths.  Let us be
filled with your presence and experience your power each day.
