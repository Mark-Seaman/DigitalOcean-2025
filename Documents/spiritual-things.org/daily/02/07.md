# Daily Meditation - February 7

## Scripture

So God's message continued to spread. The number of believers greatly increased
in Jerusalem, and many of the Jewish priests were converted, too.

But as the believers rapidly multiplied, there were rumblings of discontent. The
Greek-speaking believers complained about the Hebrew-speaking believers, saying
that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of
food.

So the Twelve called a meeting of all the believers. They said, "We apostles
should spend our time teaching the word of God, not running a food program. And
so, brothers, select seven men who are well respected and are full of the Spirit
and wisdom. We will give them this responsibility. Then we apostles can spend
our time in prayer and teaching the word.‚Äù 

Acts 6:1


## Prayer

As we gather with one another there will be inevitable conflicts and
disagreements.  This was true of your early disciples and it is true of us.
Help us to use the conflict to learn more about what you would have us do next.
Let us come together and commit to protecting the love we share while solving 
the problems of our day.
