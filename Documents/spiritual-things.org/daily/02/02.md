# Daily Meditation - February 02

## Scripture

All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to
fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord's Supper), and to
prayer.  A deep sense of awe came over them all, and the apostles performed many
miraculous signs and wonders. And all the believers met together in one place
and shared everything they had.

They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in
need. They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the
Lord's Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity â€” all the
while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day
the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.

Acts 2:42


## Prayer

Let us emulate the example of the early church by sharing time, sharing our
lives, and sharing our belongings with each other. Make of into a community of
people that are deeply committed to love.
