# Daily Meditation - April 4

## Scripture

We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning, whom we have heard
and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands. 

He is
the Word of life.  This one who is life itself was revealed to us, and we have
seen him. And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is
eternal life.

So the Word became human and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing
love and faithfulness. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one
and only Son.

1 John 1:1, John 1:14


## Prayer

Thank you for coming to earth to live and die as a human. It is the greatest
mystery of all time.  How could God become a man?  What tremendous love has
caused the creator to die as a part of his creation to bring redemption
to those who were in rebellion.  I will never fully understand this. But I
believe it to be true.  Thank you.
