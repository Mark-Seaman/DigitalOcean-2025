# Daily Meditation - April 26

## Scripture

O Lord, you have examined my heart
and know everything about me.

You know when I sit down or stand up.
You know my thoughts even when I'm far away.

You see me when I travel
and when I rest at home.
You know everything I do.

You know what I am going to say
even before I say it, Lord.

You go before me and follow me.
You place your hand of blessing on my head.

Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,
too great for me to understand!

Psalm 137


## Prayer

The knowledge that you know me better than I know myself is wonderful to me.
There is nothing about me that would shock you. This brings great comfort.
