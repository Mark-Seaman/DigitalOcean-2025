# Daily Meditation - April 19

## Scripture

One of the twelve disciples, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin), was not with the
others when Jesus came. They told him, "We have seen the Lord!”

But  he replied, "I won't believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his  hands,
put my fingers into them, and place my hand into the wound in his  side.”

Eight  days later the disciples were together again, and this time Thomas was 
with them. The doors were locked; but suddenly, as before, Jesus was  standing
among them. "Peace be with you,” he said.  Then he said to Thomas, "Put your
finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand into the wound in my side.
Don't be faithless any longer. Believe!”

"My Lord and my God!” Thomas exclaimed. Then Jesus told him, "You believe
because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me.”

John 20:17


## Prayer

Help me believe the truth, even when it is hard to fully wrap my head around
all of the details.  Give me a simple faith - like a child has in their loving
parent. Help me to trust you completely by knowing your incomparable love 
for me.
