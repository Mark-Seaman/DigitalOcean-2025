# Daily Meditation - April 11

## Scripture

When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear:
sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures,  idolatry, sorcery, hostility,
quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension,
division,  envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me
tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not
inherit the Kingdom of God.

God's promise of entering his rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with
fear that some of you might fail to experience it.  For this good news — that God
has prepared this rest — has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it
did them no good because they didn't share the faith of those who listened to
God.

Galatians 5:19, Hebrews 4:1


## Prayer

Lord, give me a pure heart and a deep desire to pursue your kingdom above all
else.  I want to live in your glorious kingdom and experience everything that
you have for me.  Don't let me miss the blessings that you give to those 
who follow you.
