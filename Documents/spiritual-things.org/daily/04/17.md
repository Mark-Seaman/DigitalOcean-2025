# Daily Meditation - April 17

## Scripture

Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the
tomb and found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. She  ran
and found Peter and John. She said, "They have taken the Lord's body out of the
tomb, and  we don't know where they have put him!”

Then the disciples who had reached the tomb went in, and they saw and
believed —  for until then they still hadn't understood the Scriptures that said
Jesus must rise from the dead.  Then they went home.

John 20:1


## Prayer

Thank you for the resurrection of Jesus and the empty tomb.  This is the climax
of human history.  It is amazing that we so often miss the significance of
the most important events in our lives.  Even your disciples had difficulty
understanding what had happened until much later.
