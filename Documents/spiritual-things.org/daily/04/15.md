# Daily Meditation - April 15

## Scripture

Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seeds. As he scattered them across his
field, some seeds fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate them. 

Other
seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seeds sprouted quickly
because the soil was shallow. But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun, and
since they didn't have deep roots, they died. Other seeds fell among thorns that
grew up and choked out the tender plants. 

Still other seeds fell on fertile
soil, and they produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times
as much as had been planted!

Matthew 13:3


## Prayer

Lord, I receive your teaching and ask that I would be a place of fertility
for your truth. May my life be fruitful and may the influence that you have had 
on me be multiplied to others.  Help me bring light to darkness and truth to 
lies.  Let me truly flourish in every way.
