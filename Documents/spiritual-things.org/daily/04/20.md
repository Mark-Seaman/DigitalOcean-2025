# Daily Meditation - April 20

## Scripture

Keep  on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and 
you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.  For
everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who
knocks, the door will be opened.

You parents — if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone
instead?  Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not! 
So  if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how  much
more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask  him.

You don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it. And even when
you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong — you want only what
will give you pleasure.

Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and live righteously, and he will give
you everything you need.

Matthew 7:7, 6:33, James 4:2


## Prayer

I confess that my motives are tainted by selfish desires.  Even when I seek
you to receive good things in my life, I often do it for the wrong reasons.
Forgive my selfishness and teach me to seek you for the joy of knowing you
better.  I trust that you will give me everything that I truly need.
