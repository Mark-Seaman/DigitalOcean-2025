# Daily Meditation - April 10

## Scripture

To one person
the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice; to another the same Spirit
gives a message of special knowledge. The same Spirit gives great faith to
another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing. 

He gives
one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy.
He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the
Spirit of God or from another spirit.  He alone decides which gift each person 
should have. 

1 Corinthians 12:8


## Prayer

Thank you for the many and varied ways that you provide gifts to your church.
Help me to embrace the gifts that you give me through other people, especially
those who are most unlike me.  Help me to faithfully deliver the gifts that
you grant through me.  Let they be untainted by my own selfish desires for 
attention.
