# Daily Meditation - April 25

## Scripture

O Lord, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth!    Your glory is higher
than the heavens. You have taught children and infants    to tell of your
strength,[b]silencing your enemies    and all who oppose you.

When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers —    the moon and
the stars you set in place — what are mere mortals that you should think about
them,    human beings that you should care for them?

O Lord, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth!

Psalm 8


## Prayer

Your glory fills the earth, and all of your creation.  And yet, you still care
about all that you have create.  It is a great mystery ... why do you care so
much for humans that you would sacrifice so much to restore us to your family.
It is too marvelous to even contemplate.
