# Daily Meditation - April 9

## Scripture

But now let me show you a way of life that is best of all.

Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church: the apostles, the prophets,
the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers. Their responsibility is to equip
God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ. 

This
will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of
God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and
complete standard of Christ.

Ephesians 4:11


## Prayer

You have given us leaders to show us how we can live our lives faithfully 
within your kingdom.   May these leaders be trustworthy and faithful to the
calling you have placed on them. When they stray from your ways reveal the
truth and restore us to the right path.  Help us to do all that we can to
honor and support those who lead us.
