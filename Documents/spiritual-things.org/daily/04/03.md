# Daily Meditation - April 3

## Scripture

He came into the very world he created, but the world didn't recognize him. He
came to his own people, and even they rejected him. But to all who believed him
and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.  They are
reborn â€” not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a
birth that comes from God.

John 1:10


## Prayer

I don't truly understand this mystery, but I accept it as true and real.  Thank
you for giving us a path to life with you.  It is so wonderful to be your child,
even though I was once far from you.  Remind me of this reality in the darkest
moments of my life.
