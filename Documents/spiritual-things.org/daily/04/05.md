# Daily Meditation - April 5

## Scripture

For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as
yourself.‚Äù But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out!
Beware of destroying one another.

So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won't be doing what
your sinful nature craves.  The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just
the opposite of what the Spirit wants. 

Galatians 5:15


## Prayer

My path to maturity is measured by how well I love. I confess that I have a long
way to go in this area.  Give me a clear picture for how to better love those
people that you have put in my life and how to express my love for you in my
obedience.
