# Daily Meditation - April 18

## Scripture

That Sunday evening the disciples were meeting behind locked doors because they
were afraid  of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was standing there among
them! "Peace be with you,” he said. 

As he spoke, he showed them the wounds in his hands and his side. They were
filled with joy when they saw the Lord!  Again he said, "Peace be with you. As
the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.” 

Then he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.  If you forgive
anyone's sins, they are forgiven. If you do not forgive them, they are not
forgiven.”

John 20:19


## Prayer

Thank you for the way that you interacted with the disciples after your 
resurrection.  It is wonderful to have eyewitness accounts of so many people that
had first-hand encounters with you at that time.  This demonstrates the
reality of the claims that these people would make, 
sometimes at the cost of their own lives.  They needed to be absolutely sure
of what they had experienced.
