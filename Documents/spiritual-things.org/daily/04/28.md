# Daily Meditation - April 28

## Scripture

And  now, dear children, remain in fellowship with Christ so that when he 
returns, you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in  shame.
Since we know that Christ is righteous, we also know that all who do what is
right are God's children.

1 Jn 2:28


## Prayer

Remaining connected to your purpose for me is the only way that I can live the
rich life that you intended.  Show me how to protect this connection.  Teach
me what it means to be faithful to my true calling.
