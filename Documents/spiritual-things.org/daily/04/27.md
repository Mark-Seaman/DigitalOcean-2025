# Daily Meditation - April 27

## Scripture

Now the time has come for the Son of Man to enter into his glory. I tell you
the truth, unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies, it remains
alone. 

But its death will produce many new kernels â€” a plentiful harvest of new
lives. Those who love their life in this world will lose it. Those who care
nothing for their life in this world will keep it for eternity. 

Anyone who wants
to serve me must follow me, because my servants must be where I am. And the
Father will honor anyone who serves me.

Jn 12:23


## Prayer

Lord, you have shown the way for everything to follow. There is a time to grow
and flouish and there is a time to die.  Only by yielding fully to the will of
My Father and trust in his Love with I be able to find my place in his plan.
Show me to true path to life.
