# Daily Meditation - April 29

## Scripture

We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning, whom we have heard
and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands. 

He is
the Word of life. This one who is life itself was revealed to us, and we have
seen him. And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is
eternal life. 

He was with the Father, and then he was revealed to us. We
proclaim to you what we ourselves have actually seen and heard so that you may
have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son,
Jesus Christ.

1 Jn 1:1


## Prayer

Thank you for giving us the eyewitnesses to the resurrection that help us to
understand what happened.  Without that, it would be difficult to believe in 
the events that were recorded.  Show me how everything is connected together
in your plan for world.
