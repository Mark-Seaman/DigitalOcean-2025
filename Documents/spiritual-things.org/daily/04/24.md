# Daily Meditation - April 24

## Scripture

Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand
around with sinners, or join in with mockers.

But they delight in the law of the Lord,
meditating on it day and night.

They are like trees planted along the riverbank,
bearing fruit each season.

Their leaves never wither,
and they prosper in all they do.

Psalm 1


## Prayer

Prosperity and satisfaction in life are tied to how I seek to do your will.
There is a part of me that is always wanting to pursue my own goals in 
opposition to your truths.  Make me like the tree planted by the riverbank
that constantly draws sustenance and prospers.
