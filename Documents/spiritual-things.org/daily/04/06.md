# Daily Meditation - April 6

## Scripture

I have discovered this principle of life â€” that when I want to do what is
right, I inevitably do what is wrong. I love God's law with all my heart. 
But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power
makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me. 

Oh, what a miserable
person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death?
Thank  God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is: In 
my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful nature  I am a
slave to sin.

Romans 7:21


## Prayer

To be human is to live with mixed motives.  I am always torn between what I 
know to be right and good and the selfish desires that complete for my attention.
Help me to seek your rule and reign in my life.  Show me the path that you 
would have me on and give me a pure heart.
