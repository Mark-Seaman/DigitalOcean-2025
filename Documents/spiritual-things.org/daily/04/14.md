# Daily Meditation - April 14

## Scripture

So the Word became human and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing
love and faithfulness. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one
and only Son.

For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that
everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. God sent his
Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.

There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not
believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only
Son. And the judgment is based on this fact: God's light came into the world,
but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil.

John 1:14, John 3:16


## Prayer

Thank you for the unimaginable sacrifice that you made to redeem the human
race.  Help me to live each day mindful of what you have completed.  Show
me how to choose light over darkness and life over death.
