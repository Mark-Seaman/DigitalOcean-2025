# Daily Meditation - April 1

## Scripture

I can never escape from your Spirit!    I can never get away from your
presence! If I go up to heaven, you are there;    if I go down to the grave,
you are there. If I ride the wings of the morning,    if I dwell by the
farthest oceans, even there your hand will guide me,    and your strength will
support me. 

I could ask the darkness to hide me    and the light around me to
become night â€”  but even in darkness I cannot hide from you.To you the night
shines as bright as day.    Darkness and light are the same to you.  


You made
all the delicate, inner parts of my body    and knit me together in my mother's
womb. Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!    Your workmanship is
marvelous - how well I know it.

Psalm 139:7


## Prayer

It is pointless to attempt to escape from your presence, and yet I still do
it. Show me how to turn toward you rather than away.  You have formed me from
nothing and know every part of body, mind, and heart.  Let me live in this
knowledge and seek to know you deeper.
