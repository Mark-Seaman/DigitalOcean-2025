# Daily Meditation - April 22

## Scripture

"Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who
builds a house on solid rock.  Though  the rain comes in torrents and the
floodwaters rise and the winds beat  against that house, it won't collapse
because it is built on bedrock.  But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't
obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand.  When the rains
and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a
mighty crash."
 
When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his
teaching, for he taught with real authority â€” quite unlike their teachers of
religious law.

Matthew 7:24


## Prayer

Help me to distinguish between what is true and what is false.  Many of us no
longer believe in any objective truth at all.  Whether it is science, politics,
society, religion, or justice, we feel that every person is completely free to 
create their own reality.  That attitude has made us vulnerable to every kind
of self-deception.  These are all houses built on sand.

In this kind of a world, I want to build my house on the rock.  Show me how
to bypass the easy answers and shortcuts.  Teach me to dig into issues to find
the deeper truths before I create opinions about the issues of this world.
