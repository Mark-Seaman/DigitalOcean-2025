# Daily Meditation - April 8

## Scripture

More and more people believed and were
brought to the Lord â€” crowds of both men and women. 

As a result of the apostles'
work, sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so that
Peter's shadow might fall across some of them as he went by. Crowds came from
the villages around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those possessed by evil
spirits, and they were all healed.

Act 5:14


## Prayer

When your presence is active within us, people are drawn to it. The results can
be quite dramatic.  We pray for your power to operate freely in our midst.
Demonstrate your kingdom as we meet together and interact.  This is something
that cannot be faked or manufactured.
