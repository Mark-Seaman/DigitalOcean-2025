# Daily Meditation - April 12

## Scripture

So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters. Whatever is good and perfect
comes down to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens.
He never changes or casts a shifting shadow. He chose to give birth to us by
giving us his true word. And we, out of all creation, became his prized
possession.

James 1:16


## Prayer

I acknowledge that everything good in my life is ultimately from you. From all
of the physical to the psychological and spiritual needs - you meet them all.
Thank you for all of the ways that your redemption plays out in my life.  Give
me eyes and see and appreciate your glorious blessings.
