# Daily Meditation - April 2

## Scripture

Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!    Your workmanship is
marvelous â€” how well I know it. You watched me as I was being formed in utter
seclusion,    as I was woven together in the dark of the womb. You saw me
before I was born.    

Every day of my life was recorded in your book. Every
moment was laid out    before a single day had passed.  

How precious are your
thoughts about me, O God.    They cannot be numbered! I can't even count
them;    they outnumber the grains of sand!And when I wake up,    you are still
with me!

Psalm 139:14


## Prayer

Your care for me goes far beyond what I can ever understand. It is not rooted
in what I can do for others, or even for you.  Your love is based solely on
your decision to love without any requirements in return.  Thank you for this
love that knows no bounds.  May I bring you joy as I return your love.
