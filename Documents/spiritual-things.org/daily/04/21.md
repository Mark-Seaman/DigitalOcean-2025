# Daily Meditation - April 21

## Scripture

Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of
all that is taught in the law and the prophets.

You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell
is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. But the gateway
to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.

Matthew 7:12


## Prayer

Teach me to stay on the narrow path that leads to life.  Show me how to walk
in your kingdom ways.  Lead me daily so that I might be constantly under 
your authority in every area of my life.
