# Daily Meditation - April 30

## Scripture

If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall. The  temptations
in your life are no different from what others experience.  And God is faithful.
He will not allow the temptation to be more than  you can stand. When you are
tempted, he will show you a way out so that  you can endure.

1 Co 10:12


## Prayer

Lord, help me to understand the vulnerabilities that may trip me up.  I desire
to follow you in all areas of my life, but am constantly tempted to seek my own
will rather than yours.
