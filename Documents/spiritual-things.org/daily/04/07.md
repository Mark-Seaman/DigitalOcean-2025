# Daily Meditation - April 7

## Scripture

And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. I
want to do what is right, but I can't. I want to do what is good, but I don't. I
don't want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. But if I do what I don't
want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that
does it.

Romans 7:18


## Prayer

Lord, I confess my fickle nature to you.  I'm always split between the desire
to seek your kingdom and build my own kingdom.  Search my heart and bring to
light the areas where this battle rages.  It is only your presence in my 
life that gives me any hope of walking in your kingdom.
