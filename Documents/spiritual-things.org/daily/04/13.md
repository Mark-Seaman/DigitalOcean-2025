# Daily Meditation - April 13

## Scripture

Peter replied, "Each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God, and be
baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you
will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. This promise is to you, and to your
children, and even to the Gentiles — all who have been called by the Lord our
God.” 

Then Peter continued preaching for a long time, strongly urging all his
listeners, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation! There is salvation in no 
one else but Jesus! God has given no other name under heaven by
which we must be saved.” 

Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that
day — about 3,000 in all. 

Acts 2:38


## Prayer

Thank you for the simplicity of this message.  Even though it is filled with
mystery, the core message is simple and easy to understand.  We must turn
from seeking our will to pursue your will for our lives. This is all it means
to be saved from the consequences of rebellion against you.  This day I renew
my commitment to follow you where ever you may lead me.
