You will be in Babylon for seventy years. But then I will come and do for you
all the good things I have promised, and I will bring you home again.  For I
know the plans I have for you. They are plans for good and not for disaster, to
give you a future and a hope. In those days when you pray, I will listen.  If
you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me.  I will be found by you. I
will end your captivity and restore your fortunes. I will gather you out of the
nations where I sent you and will bring you home again to your own land.
