Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and
lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of
praise. Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from
me-everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be
with you.
