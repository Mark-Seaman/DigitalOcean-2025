In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God's promises. Supplement
your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence
with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient
endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly
affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone. The more you grow
like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ.
