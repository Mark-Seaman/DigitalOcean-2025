And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to
follow him.  Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on
him.

Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will
overflow with thankfulness.

Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense
that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers of this world,
rather than from Christ.
