For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In
the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a
great harvest of generosity in you.

Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous.
And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God.
