There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source
of them all. There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord.
God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of
us. A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.  It is
the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which
gift each person should have.
