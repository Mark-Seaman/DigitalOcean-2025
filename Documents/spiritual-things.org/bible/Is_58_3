Even while you fast,
you keep oppressing your workers.

What good is fasting
when you keep on fighting and quarreling?

This kind of fasting
will never get you anywhere with me.

You humble yourselves
by going through the motions of penance,

bowing your heads
like reeds bending in the wind.

You dress in burlap
and cover yourselves with ashes.

Is this what you call fasting?
Do you really think this will please the Lord?
