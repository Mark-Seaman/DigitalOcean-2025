Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved
privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to
sharing God's glory.

We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they
help us develop endurance. And endurance develops strength of character, and
character strengthens our confident hope of salvation. And this hope will not
lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has
given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.
