You may believe there's nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it
between yourself and God.

Blessed are those who don't feel guilty for doing something they have decided is
right.

But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are
sinning if you go ahead and do it.

For you are not following your convictions.

If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.
