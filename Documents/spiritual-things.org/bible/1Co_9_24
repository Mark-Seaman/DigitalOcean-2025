Don't you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the
prize? So run to win!  All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do
it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize.  So I
run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing.  I discipline my
body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that
after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.
