Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep. Live in harmony
with each other.

Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can
see you are honorable. 

Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone. Live in harmony with each other. 

Don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you
know it all!

Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God.
