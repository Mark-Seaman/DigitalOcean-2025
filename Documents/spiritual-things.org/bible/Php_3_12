I don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have
already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for  which
Christ Jesus first possessed me.  No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not
achieved it, but I focus on this  one thing: Forgetting the past and looking
forward to what lies ahead, I press  on to reach the end of the race and receive
the heavenly prize for which God,  through Christ Jesus, is calling us.
