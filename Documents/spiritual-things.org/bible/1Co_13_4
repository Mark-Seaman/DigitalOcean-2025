Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud or rude. It
does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of
being wronged. It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the
truth wins out. Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and
endures through every circumstance.
