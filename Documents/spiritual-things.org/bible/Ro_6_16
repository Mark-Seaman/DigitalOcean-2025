Don't you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You
can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God,
which leads to righteous living. Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but
now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you. Now you are free
from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living.

Therefore, you are not slaves to your sinful nature and its urges. Living by its
dictates will kill you. But the Spirit's power gives life and victory over your
sinful nature. All who are led by the God's Spirit are his children.
