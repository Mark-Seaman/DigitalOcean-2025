And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him.  For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation.  So we are Christ's ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, "Come back to God!"
