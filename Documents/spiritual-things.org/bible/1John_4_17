And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect. So we will not be afraid on
the day of judgment, but we can face him with confidence because we live like
Jesus here in this world.

Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear. If we are
afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows that we have not fully
experienced his perfect love. We love each other because he loved us first.
