But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants
it. In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are
actually the most necessary.This makes for harmony among the members, so that
all the members care for each other. If one part suffers, all the parts suffer
with it, and if one part is honored, all the parts are glad.
