I am the Lord, who opened a way through the waters, making a dry path through
the sea. But forget all that - it is nothing compared to what I am going to do.
For I am about to do something new. See, I have already begun! Do you not see
it? I will make a pathway through the wilderness. I will create rivers in the
dry wasteland.
