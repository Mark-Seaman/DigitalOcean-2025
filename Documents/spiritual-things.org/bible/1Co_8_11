So because of your superior knowledge, a weak believer for whom Christ died will
be destroyed.  And when you sin against other believers by encouraging them to
do something they believe is wrong, you are sinning against Christ.

So if what I eat causes another believer to sin, I will never eat meat again as
long as I live - for I don't want to cause another believer to stumble.
