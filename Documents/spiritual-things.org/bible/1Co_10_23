You say, "I am allowed to do anything" - but not everything is good for you. You
say, "I am allowed to do anything" - but not everything is beneficial. Don't be
concerned for your own good but for the good of others.

It might not be a matter of conscience for you, but it is for the other person.
For why should my freedom be limited by what someone else thinks?


So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
Don't give offense to Jews or Gentiles or the church of God. I, too, try to
please everyone in everything I do. 

I don't just do what is best for me; I do what is best for others so that many
may be saved. And you should imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.
