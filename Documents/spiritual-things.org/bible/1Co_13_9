Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete, and even the gift of prophecy
reveals only part of the whole picture! Now we see things imperfectly, like
puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect
clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know
everything completely, just as God now knows me completely. Three things will
last forever-faith, hope, and love-and the greatest of these is love.
