When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring
the weak to Christ. Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing
everything I can to save some.

I do everything to spread the Good News and share in its blessings. Don't you
realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run
to win!

All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that
will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize. So I run with purpose in
every step. I am not just shadowboxing.

I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should.
Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.
