First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend’s eye.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t waste what is holy on people who are unholy.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> Don’t throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.</font><h5>Effective Prayer</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You parents—if your children ask for a loaf of bread, do you give them a stone instead?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Or if they ask for a fish, do you give them a snake? Of course not!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him.</font><h5>The Golden Rule</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.</font><h5>The Narrow Gate</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You can enter God’s Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.</font><h5>The Tree and Its Fruit</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>A good tree can’t produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can’t produce good fruit.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.</font><h5>True Disciples</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Not everyone who calls out to me, ‘Lord! Lord!’ will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>On judgment day many will say to me, ‘Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But I will reply, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God’s laws.’</font><h5>Building on a Solid Foundation</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won’t collapse because it is built on bedrock.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn’t obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash.”</font><p />&nbsp; When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,  for he taught with real authority—quite unlike their teachers of religious law.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
