At that time the highly valued slave of a Roman officer<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> was sick and near death.  When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent some respected Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his slave.  So they earnestly begged Jesus to help the man. “If anyone deserves your help, he does,” they said,  “for he loves the Jewish people and even built a synagogue for us.”<p />&nbsp; So Jesus went with them. But just before they arrived at the house, the officer sent some friends to say, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself by coming to my home, for I am not worthy of such an honor.  I am not even worthy to come and meet you. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed.  I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, ‘Go,’ and they go, or ‘Come,’ and they come. And if I say to my slaves, ‘Do this,’ they do it.”<p />&nbsp; When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you, I haven’t seen faith like this in all Israel!”</font>  And when the officer’s friends returned to his house, they found the slave completely healed.<h5>Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son</h5>&nbsp; Soon afterward Jesus went with his disciples to the village of Nain, and a large crowd followed him.  A funeral procession was coming out as he approached the village gate. The young man who had died was a widow’s only son, and a large crowd from the village was with her.  When the Lord saw her, his heart overflowed with compassion. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t cry!”</font> he said.  Then he walked over to the coffin and touched it, and the bearers stopped. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Young man,”</font> he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you, get up.”</font>  Then the dead boy sat up and began to talk! And Jesus gave him back to his mother.<p />&nbsp; Great fear swept the crowd, and they praised God, saying, “A mighty prophet has risen among us,” and “God has visited his people today.”  And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding countryside.<h5>Jesus and John the Baptist</h5>&nbsp; The disciples of John the Baptist told John about everything Jesus was doing. So John called for two of his disciples,  and he sent them to the Lord to ask him, “Are you the Messiah we’ve been expecting,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> or should we keep looking for someone else?”<p />&nbsp; John’s two disciples found Jesus and said to him, “John the Baptist sent us to ask, ‘Are you the Messiah we’ve been expecting, or should we keep looking for someone else?’”<p />&nbsp; At that very time, Jesus cured many people of their diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits, and he restored sight to many who were blind.  Then he told John’s disciples, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Go back to John and tell him what you have seen and heard—the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And tell him, ‘God blesses those who do not turn away because of me.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>’”</font><p />&nbsp; After John’s disciples left, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are found in palaces.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Were you looking for a prophet? Yes, and he is more than a prophet.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>‘Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and he will prepare your way before you.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of God is greater than he is!”</font><p />&nbsp; When they heard this, all the people—even the tax collectors—agreed that God’s way was right,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> for they had been baptized by John.  But the Pharisees and experts in religious law rejected God’s plan for them, for they had refused John’s baptism.<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“To what can I compare the people of this generation?”</font> Jesus asked. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“How can I describe them?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>They are like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>‘We played wedding songs,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and you didn’t dance,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>so we played funeral songs,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and you didn’t weep.’</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>For John the Baptist didn’t spend his time eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, ‘He’s possessed by a demon.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The Son of Man,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, ‘He’s a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But wisdom is shown to be right by the lives of those who follow it.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><h5>Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman</h5>&nbsp; One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>  When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume.  Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them.<p />&nbsp; When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She’s a sinner!”<p />&nbsp; Then Jesus answered his thoughts. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Simon,”</font> he said to the Pharisee, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I have something to say to you.”</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Go ahead, Teacher,” Simon replied.<p />&nbsp; Then Jesus told him this story: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“A man loaned money to two people—500 pieces of silver<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> to one and 50 pieces to the other.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But neither of them could repay him, so he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts. Who do you suppose loved him more after that?”</font><p />&nbsp; Simon answered, “I suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt.”<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>“That’s right,”</font> Jesus said.  Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Look at this woman kneeling here. When I entered your home, you didn’t offer me water to wash the dust from my feet, but she has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You didn’t greet me with a kiss, but from the time I first came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head, but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you, her sins—and they are many—have been forgiven, so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love.”</font>  Then Jesus said to the woman, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Your sins are forgiven.”</font><p />&nbsp; The men at the table said among themselves, “Who is this man, that he goes around forgiving sins?”<p />&nbsp; And Jesus said to the woman, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Your faith has saved you; go in peace.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
