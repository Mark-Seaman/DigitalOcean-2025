if you have trapped yourself by your agreement<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are caught by what you said—<br />&nbsp; follow my advice and save yourself,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you have placed yourself at your friend’s mercy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now swallow your pride;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go and beg to have your name erased.<br />&nbsp; Don’t put it off; do it now!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t rest until you do.<br />&nbsp; Save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a bird fleeing from a net.<p />&nbsp; Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn from their ways and become wise!<br />&nbsp; Though they have no prince<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or governor or ruler to make them work,<br />&nbsp; they labor hard all summer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathering food for the winter.<br />&nbsp; But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will you wake up?<br />&nbsp; A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little folding of the hands to rest—<br />&nbsp; then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.<p />&nbsp; What are worthless and wicked people like?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are constant liars,<br />&nbsp; signaling their deceit with a wink of the eye,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a nudge of the foot, or the wiggle of fingers.<br />&nbsp; Their perverted hearts plot evil,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they constantly stir up trouble.<br />&nbsp; But they will be destroyed suddenly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broken in an instant beyond all hope of healing.<p />&nbsp; There are six things the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> hates—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no, seven things he detests:<br />&nbsp; haughty eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lying tongue,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands that kill the innocent,<br />&nbsp; a heart that plots evil,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet that race to do wrong,<br />&nbsp; a false witness who pours out lies,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a person who sows discord in a family.<p />&nbsp; My son, obey your father’s commands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and don’t neglect your mother’s instruction.<br />&nbsp; Keep their words always in your heart.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tie them around your neck.<br />&nbsp; When you walk, their counsel will lead you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you sleep, they will protect you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you wake up, they will advise you.<br />&nbsp; For their command is a lamp<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their instruction a light;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their corrective discipline<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the way to life.<br />&nbsp; It will keep you from the immoral woman,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the smooth tongue of a promiscuous woman.<br />&nbsp; Don’t lust for her beauty.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t let her coy glances seduce you.<br />&nbsp; For a prostitute will bring you to poverty,<sup></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but sleeping with another man’s wife will cost you your life.<br />&nbsp; Can a man scoop a flame into his lap<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not have his clothes catch on fire?<br />&nbsp; Can he walk on hot coals<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not blister his feet?<br />&nbsp; So it is with the man who sleeps with another man’s wife.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who embraces her will not go unpunished.<p />&nbsp; Excuses might be found for a thief<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who steals because he is starving.<br />&nbsp; But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if he has to sell everything in his house.<br />&nbsp; But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he destroys himself.<br />&nbsp; He will be wounded and disgraced.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shame will never be erased.<br />&nbsp; For the woman’s jealous husband will be furious,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.<br />&nbsp; He will accept no compensation,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor be satisfied with a payoff of any size.</p><p />
