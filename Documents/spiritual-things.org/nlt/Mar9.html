As the men watched, Jesus’ appearance was transformed,  and his clothes became dazzling white, far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them.  Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus.<p />&nbsp; Peter exclaimed, “Rabbi, it’s wonderful for us to be here! Let’s make three shelters as memorials<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  He said this because he didn’t really know what else to say, for they were all terrified.<p />&nbsp; Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my dearly loved Son. Listen to him.”  Suddenly, when they looked around, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus with them.<p />&nbsp; As they went back down the mountain, he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> had risen from the dead.  So they kept it to themselves, but they often asked each other what he meant by “rising from the dead.”<p />&nbsp; Then they asked him, “Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”<p />&nbsp; Jesus responded, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready. Yet why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man must suffer greatly and be treated with utter contempt?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they chose to abuse him, just as the Scriptures predicted.”</font><h5>Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy</h5>&nbsp; When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them, and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them.  When the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe, and they ran to greet him.<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What is all this arguing about?”</font> Jesus asked.<p />&nbsp; One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said, “Teacher, I brought my son so you could heal him. He is possessed by an evil spirit that won’t let him talk.  And whenever this spirit seizes him, it throws him violently to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> So I asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they couldn’t do it.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus said to them,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”</font><p />&nbsp; So they brought the boy. But when the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the child into a violent convulsion, and he fell to the ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“How long has this been happening?”</font> Jesus asked the boy’s father.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied, “Since he was a little boy.  The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water, trying to kill him. Have mercy on us and help us, if you can.”<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What do you mean, ‘If I can’?”</font> Jesus asked. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anything is possible if a person believes.”</font><p />&nbsp; The father instantly cried out, “I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!”<p />&nbsp; When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing, he rebuked the evil<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> spirit. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Listen, you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak,”</font> he said. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I command you to come out of this child and never enter him again!”</font><p />&nbsp; Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, “He’s dead.”  But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.<p />&nbsp; Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, “Why couldn’t we cast out that evil spirit?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“This kind can be cast out only by prayer.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><h5>Jesus Again Predicts His Death</h5>&nbsp; Leaving that region, they traveled through Galilee. Jesus didn’t want anyone to know he was there,  for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them. He said to them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies. He will be killed, but three days later he will rise from the dead.”</font>  They didn’t understand what he was saying, however, and they were afraid to ask him what he meant.<h5>The Greatest in the Kingdom</h5>&nbsp; After they arrived at Capernaum and settled in a house, Jesus asked his disciples, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What were you discussing out on the road?”</font>  But they didn’t answer, because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.  He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then he put a little child among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them,  <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes not only me but also my Father who sent me.”</font><h5>Using the Name of Jesus</h5>&nbsp; John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he wasn’t in our group.”<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t stop him!”</font> Jesus said. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“No one who performs a miracle in my name will soon be able to speak evil of me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Anyone who is not against us is for us.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If anyone gives you even a cup of water because you belong to the Messiah, I tell you the truth, that person will surely be rewarded.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It’s better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> with two hands.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It’s better to enter eternal life with only one foot than to be thrown into hell with two feet.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. It’s better to enter the Kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>‘where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“For everyone will be tested with fire.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor, how do you make it salty again? You must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
