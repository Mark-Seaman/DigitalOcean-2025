These people are hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are dead.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; They will say it is wrong to be married and wrong to eat certain foods. But God created those foods to be eaten with thanks by faithful people who know the truth.  Since everything God created is good, we should not reject any of it but receive it with thanks.  For we know it is made acceptable<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> by the word of God and prayer.<h5>A Good Servant of Christ Jesus</h5>&nbsp; If you explain these things to the brothers and sisters,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> Timothy, you will be a worthy servant of Christ Jesus, one who is nourished by the message of faith and the good teaching you have followed.  Do not waste time arguing over godless ideas and old wives’ tales. Instead, train yourself to be godly.  “Physical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come.”  This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it.  This is why we work hard and continue to struggle,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> for our hope is in the living God, who is the Savior of all people and particularly of all believers.<p />&nbsp; Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them.  Don’t let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity.  Until I get there, focus on reading the Scriptures to the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching them.<p />&nbsp; Do not neglect the spiritual gift you received through the prophecy spoken over you when the elders of the church laid their hands on you.  Give your complete attention to these matters. Throw yourself into your tasks so that everyone will see your progress.  Keep a close watch on how you live and on your teaching. Stay true to what is right for the sake of your own salvation and the salvation of those who hear you.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
