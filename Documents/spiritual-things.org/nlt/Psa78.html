for I will speak to you in a parable.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will teach you hidden lessons from our past—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stories we have heard and known,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stories our ancestors handed down to us.<br />&nbsp; We will not hide these truths from our children;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we will tell the next generation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the glorious deeds of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about his power and his mighty wonders.<br />&nbsp; For he issued his laws to Jacob;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gave his instructions to Israel.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He commanded our ancestors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to teach them to their children,<br />&nbsp; so the next generation might know them—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the children not yet born—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they in turn will teach their own children.<br />&nbsp; So each generation should set its hope anew on God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not forgetting his glorious miracles<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and obeying his commands.<br />&nbsp; Then they will not be like their ancestors—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stubborn, rebellious, and unfaithful,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refusing to give their hearts to God.<p />&nbsp; The warriors of Ephraim, though armed with bows,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned their backs and fled on the day of battle.<br />&nbsp; They did not keep God’s covenant<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refused to live by his instructions.<br />&nbsp; They forgot what he had done—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great wonders he had shown them,<br />&nbsp; the miracles he did for their ancestors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt.<br />&nbsp; For he divided the sea and led them through,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making the water stand up like walls!<br />&nbsp; In the daytime he led them by a cloud,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all night by a pillar of fire.<br />&nbsp; He split open the rocks in the wilderness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to give them water, as from a gushing spring.<br />&nbsp; He made streams pour from the rock,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;making the waters flow down like a river!<p />&nbsp; Yet they kept on sinning against him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebelling against the Most High in the desert.<br />&nbsp; They stubbornly tested God in their hearts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demanding the foods they craved.<br />&nbsp; They even spoke against God himself, saying,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“God can’t give us food in the wilderness.<br />&nbsp; Yes, he can strike a rock so water gushes out,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he can’t give his people bread and meat.”<br />&nbsp; When the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> heard them, he was furious.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fire of his wrath burned against Jacob.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, his anger rose against Israel,<br />&nbsp; for they did not believe God<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or trust him to care for them.<br />&nbsp; But he commanded the skies to open;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he opened the doors of heaven.<br />&nbsp;  He rained down manna for them to eat;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gave them bread from heaven.<br />&nbsp; They ate the food of angels!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God gave them all they could hold.<br />&nbsp; He released the east wind in the heavens<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and guided the south wind by his mighty power.<br />&nbsp; He rained down meat as thick as dust—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birds as plentiful as the sand on the seashore!<br />&nbsp; He caused the birds to fall within their camp<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all around their tents.<br />&nbsp; The people ate their fill.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gave them what they craved.<br />&nbsp; But before they satisfied their craving,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the meat was yet in their mouths,<br />&nbsp; the anger of God rose against them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he killed their strongest men.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He struck down the finest of Israel’s young men.<p />&nbsp; But in spite of this, the people kept sinning.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite his wonders, they refused to trust him.<br />&nbsp; So he ended their lives in failure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their years in terror.<br />&nbsp; When God began killing them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they finally sought him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They repented and took God seriously.<br />&nbsp; Then they remembered that God was their rock,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that God Most High<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> was their redeemer.<br />&nbsp; But all they gave him was lip service;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they lied to him with their tongues.<br />&nbsp; Their hearts were not loyal to him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not keep his covenant.<br />&nbsp; Yet he was merciful and forgave their sins<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not destroy them all.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times he held back his anger<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not unleash his fury!<br />&nbsp; For he remembered that they were merely mortal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone like a breath of wind that never returns.<p />&nbsp; Oh, how often they rebelled against him in the wilderness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grieved his heart in that dry wasteland.<br />&nbsp; Again and again they tested God’s patience<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br />&nbsp; They did not remember his power<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and how he rescued them from their enemies.<br />&nbsp; They did not remember his miraculous signs in Egypt,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wonders on the plain of Zoan.<br />&nbsp; For he turned their rivers into blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so no one could drink from the streams.<br />&nbsp; He sent vast swarms of flies to consume them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hordes of frogs to ruin them.<br />&nbsp; He gave their crops to caterpillars;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their harvest was consumed by locusts.<br />&nbsp; He destroyed their grapevines with hail<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shattered their sycamore-figs with sleet.<br />&nbsp; He abandoned their cattle to the hail,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their livestock to bolts of lightning.<br />&nbsp; He loosed on them his fierce anger—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all his fury, rage, and hostility.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dispatched against them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a band of destroying angels.<br />&nbsp; He turned his anger against them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did not spare the Egyptians’ lives<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but ravaged them with the plague.<br />&nbsp; He killed the oldest son in each Egyptian family,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the flower of youth throughout the land of Egypt.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp; But he led his own people like a flock of sheep,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guiding them safely through the wilderness.<br />&nbsp; He kept them safe so they were not afraid;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the sea covered their enemies.<br />&nbsp; He brought them to the border of his holy land,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this land of hills he had won for them.<br />&nbsp; He drove out the nations before them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gave them their inheritance by lot.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He settled the tribes of Israel into their homes.<p />&nbsp; But they kept testing and rebelling against God Most High.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not obey his laws.<br />&nbsp; They turned back and were as faithless as their parents.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were as undependable as a crooked bow.<br />&nbsp; They angered God by building shrines to other gods;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they made him jealous with their idols.<br />&nbsp; When God heard them, he was very angry,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he completely rejected Israel.<br />&nbsp; Then he abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Tabernacle where he had lived among the people.<br />&nbsp; He allowed the Ark of his might to be captured;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he surrendered his glory into enemy hands.<br />&nbsp; He gave his people over to be butchered by the sword,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he was so angry with his own people—his special possession.<br />&nbsp; Their young men were killed by fire;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their young women died before singing their wedding songs.<br />&nbsp; Their priests were slaughtered,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their widows could not mourn their deaths.<p />&nbsp; Then the Lord rose up as though waking from sleep,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a warrior aroused from a drunken stupor.<br />&nbsp; He routed his enemies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sent them to eternal shame.<br />&nbsp; But he rejected Joseph’s descendants;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.<br />&nbsp; He chose instead the tribe of Judah,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Mount Zion, which he loved.<br />&nbsp; There he built his sanctuary as high as the heavens,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as solid and enduring as the earth.<br />&nbsp; He chose his servant David,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling him from the sheep pens.<br />&nbsp; He took David from tending the ewes and lambs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made him the shepherd of Jacob’s descendants—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s own people, Israel.<br />&nbsp; He cared for them with a true heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and led them with skillful hands.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
