But he responded, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!”</font><p />&nbsp; Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him privately and said, “Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will signal your return and the end of the world?<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”<p />&nbsp; Jesus told them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t let anyone mislead you,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>for many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah.’ They will deceive many.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don’t panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won’t follow immediately.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, so that all nations<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> will hear it; and then the end will come.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The day is coming when you will see what Daniel the prophet spoke about—the sacrilegious object that causes desecration<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> standing in the Holy Place.”</font> (Reader, pay attention!)  <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Then those in Judea must flee to the hills.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And pray that your flight will not be in winter or on the Sabbath.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For there will be greater anguish than at any time since the world began. And it will never be so great again.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In fact, unless that time of calamity is shortened, not a single person will survive. But it will be shortened for the sake of God’s chosen ones.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah,’ or ‘There he is,’ don’t believe it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God’s chosen ones.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>See, I have warned you about this ahead of time.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“So if someone tells you, ‘Look, the Messiah is out in the desert,’ don’t bother to go and look. Or, ‘Look, he is hiding here,’ don’t believe it!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For as the lightning flashes in the east and shines to the west, so it will be when the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> comes.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate that the end is near.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Immediately after the anguish of those days,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>the sun will be darkened,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>the moon will give no light,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>the stars will fall from the sky,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>And then at last, the sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens, and there will be deep mourning among all the peoples of the earth. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And he will send out his angels with the mighty blast of a trumpet, and they will gather his chosen ones from all over the world<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>—from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In the same way, when you see all these things, you can know his return is very near, right at the door.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you the truth, this generation<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> will not pass from the scene until all these things take place.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> Only the Father knows.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah’s day.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In those days before the flood, the people were enjoying banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>People didn’t realize what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is the way it will be when the Son of Man comes.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Two men will be working together in the field; one will be taken, the other left.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Two women will be grinding flour at the mill; one will be taken, the other left.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“So you, too, must keep watch! For you don’t know what day your Lord is coming.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Understand this: If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming, he would keep watch and not permit his house to be broken into.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You also must be ready all the time, for the Son of Man will come when least expected.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“A faithful, sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job, there will be a reward.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you the truth, the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But what if the servant is evil and thinks, ‘My master won’t be back for a while,’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>and he begins beating the other servants, partying, and getting drunk?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The master will return unannounced and unexpected,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>and he will cut the servant to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
