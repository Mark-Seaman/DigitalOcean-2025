For their hearts plot violence,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their words always stir up trouble.<p />&nbsp; A house is built by wisdom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and becomes strong through good sense.<br />&nbsp; Through knowledge its rooms are filled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all sorts of precious riches and valuables.<p />&nbsp; The wise are mightier than the strong,<sup></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those with knowledge grow stronger and stronger.<br />&nbsp; So don’t go to war without wise guidance;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;victory depends on having many advisers.<p />&nbsp; Wisdom is too lofty for fools.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among leaders at the city gate, they have nothing to say.<p />&nbsp; A person who plans evil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will get a reputation as a troublemaker.<br />&nbsp; The schemes of a fool are sinful;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everyone detests a mocker.<p />&nbsp; If you fail under pressure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your strength is too small.<p />&nbsp; Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to die;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save them as they stagger to their death.<br />&nbsp; Don’t excuse yourself by saying, “Look, we didn’t know.”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God understands all hearts, and he sees you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who guards your soul knows you knew.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will repay all people as their actions deserve.<p />&nbsp; My child,<sup></sup> eat honey, for it is good,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the honeycomb is sweet to the taste.<br />&nbsp; In the same way, wisdom is sweet to your soul.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find it, you will have a bright future,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your hopes will not be cut short.<p />&nbsp; Don’t wait in ambush at the home of the godly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and don’t raid the house where the godly live.<br />&nbsp; The godly may trip seven times, but they will get up again.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one disaster is enough to overthrow the wicked.<p />&nbsp; Don’t rejoice when your enemies fall;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don’t be happy when they stumble.<br />&nbsp; For the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> will be displeased with you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will turn his anger away from them.<p />&nbsp; Don’t fret because of evildoers;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don’t envy the wicked.<br />&nbsp; For evil people have no future;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the light of the wicked will be snuffed out.<p />&nbsp; My child, fear the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and the king.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t associate with rebels,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for disaster will hit them suddenly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who knows what punishment will come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and the king?<h5>More Sayings of the Wise</h5>&nbsp; Here are some further sayings of the wise:<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wrong to show favoritism when passing judgment.<br />&nbsp; A judge who says to the wicked, “You are innocent,”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be cursed by many people and denounced by the nations.<br />&nbsp; But it will go well for those who convict the guilty;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rich blessings will be showered on them.<p />&nbsp; An honest answer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like a kiss of friendship.<p />&nbsp; Do your planning and prepare your fields<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before building your house.<p />&nbsp; Don’t testify against your neighbors without cause;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don’t lie about them.<br />&nbsp; And don’t say, “Now I can pay them back for what they’ve done to me!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll get even with them!”<p />&nbsp; I walked by the field of a lazy person,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vineyard of one with no common sense.<br />&nbsp; I saw that it was overgrown with nettles.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was covered with weeds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its walls were broken down.<br />&nbsp; Then, as I looked and thought about it,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned this lesson:<br />&nbsp; A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a little folding of the hands to rest—<br />&nbsp; then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.</p><p />
