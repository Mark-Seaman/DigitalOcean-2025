Aha!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our own eyes we saw him do it!”<p />&nbsp; O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, you know all about this.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stay silent.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not abandon me now, O Lord.<br />&nbsp; Wake up! Rise to my defense!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take up my case, my God and my Lord.<br />&nbsp; Declare me not guilty, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> my God, for you give justice.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t let my enemies laugh about me in my troubles.<br />&nbsp; Don’t let them say, “Look, we got what we wanted!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we will eat him alive!”<p />&nbsp; May those who rejoice at my troubles<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be humiliated and disgraced.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May those who triumph over me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be covered with shame and dishonor.<br />&nbsp; But give great joy to those who came to my defense.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them continually say, “Great is the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who delights in blessing his servant with peace!”<br />&nbsp; Then I will proclaim your justice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will praise you all day long.</p><p /></div>
