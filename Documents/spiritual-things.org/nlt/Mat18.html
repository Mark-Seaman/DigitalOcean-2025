Then he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you the truth, unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“And anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> is welcoming me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What sorrow awaits the world, because it tempts people to sin. Temptations are inevitable, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It’s better to enter eternal life with only one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with both of your hands and feet.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It’s better to enter eternal life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Beware that you don’t look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my heavenly Father.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><h5>Parable of the Lost Sheep</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away, what will he do? Won’t he leave the ninety-nine others on the hills and go out to search for the one that is lost?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he will rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that didn’t wander away!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In the same way, it is not my heavenly Father’s will that even one of these little ones should perish.</font><h5>Correcting Another Believer</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“If another believer<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> sins against you,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she won’t accept the church’s decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you the truth, whatever you forbid<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> on earth will be permitted in heaven.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I also tell you this: If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For where two or three gather together as my followers,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> I am there among them.”</font><h5>Parable of the Unforgiving Debtor</h5>&nbsp; Then Peter came to him and asked, “Lord, how often should I forgive someone<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> who sins against me? Seven times?”<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“No, not seven times,”</font> Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“but seventy times seven!<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In the process, one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>He couldn’t pay, so his master ordered that he be sold—along with his wife, his children, and everything he owned—to pay the debt.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But the man fell down before his master and begged him, ‘Please, be patient with me, and I will pay it all.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then his master was filled with pity for him, and he released him and forgave his debt.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But when the man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“His fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time. ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it,’ he pleaded.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But his creditor wouldn’t wait. He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“When some of the other servants saw this, they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that had happened.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said, ‘You evil servant! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Shouldn’t you have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“That’s what my heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> from your heart.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
