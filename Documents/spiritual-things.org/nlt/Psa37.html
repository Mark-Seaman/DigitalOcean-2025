For like grass, they soon fade away.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like spring flowers, they soon wither.<p />&nbsp; Trust in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and do good.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you will live safely in the land and prosper.<br />&nbsp; Take delight in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will give you your heart’s desires.<p />&nbsp; Commit everything you do to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust him, and he will help you.<br />&nbsp; He will make your innocence radiate like the dawn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the justice of your cause will shine like the noonday sun.<p />&nbsp; Be still in the presence of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wait patiently for him to act.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t worry about evil people who prosper<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or fret about their wicked schemes.<p />&nbsp; Stop being angry!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn from your rage!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not lose your temper—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it only leads to harm.<br />&nbsp; For the wicked will be destroyed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who trust in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> will possess the land.<p />&nbsp; Soon the wicked will disappear.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though you look for them, they will be gone.<br />&nbsp; The lowly will possess the land<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will live in peace and prosperity.<p />&nbsp; The wicked plot against the godly;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they snarl at them in defiance.<br />&nbsp; But the Lord just laughs,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he sees their day of judgment coming.<p />&nbsp; The wicked draw their swords<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and string their bows<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to kill the poor and the oppressed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to slaughter those who do right.<br />&nbsp; But their swords will stab their own hearts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their bows will be broken.<p />&nbsp; It is better to be godly and have little<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than to be evil and rich.<br />&nbsp; For the strength of the wicked will be shattered,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> takes care of the godly.<p />&nbsp; Day by day the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> takes care of the innocent,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will receive an inheritance that lasts forever.<br />&nbsp; They will not be disgraced in hard times;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even in famine they will have more than enough.<p />&nbsp; But the wicked will die.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s enemies are like flowers in a field—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will disappear like smoke.<p />&nbsp; The wicked borrow and never repay,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the godly are generous givers.<br />&nbsp; Those the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> blesses will possess the land,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those he curses will die.<p />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> directs the steps of the godly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He delights in every detail of their lives.<br />&nbsp; Though they stumble, they will never fall,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> holds them by the hand.<p />&nbsp; Once I was young, and now I am old.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I have never seen the godly abandoned<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or their children begging for bread.<br />&nbsp; The godly always give generous loans to others,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their children are a blessing.<p />&nbsp; Turn from evil and do good,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will live in the land forever.<br />&nbsp; For the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> loves justice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will never abandon the godly.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will keep them safe forever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the children of the wicked will die.<br />&nbsp; The godly will possess the land<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will live there forever.<p />&nbsp; The godly offer good counsel;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they teach right from wrong.<br />&nbsp; They have made God’s law their own,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they will never slip from his path.<p />&nbsp; The wicked wait in ambush for the godly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking for an excuse to kill them.<br />&nbsp; But the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> will not let the wicked succeed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or let the godly be condemned when they are put on trial.<p />&nbsp; Put your hope in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Travel steadily along his path.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will honor you by giving you the land.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will see the wicked destroyed.<p />&nbsp; I have seen wicked and ruthless people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flourishing like a tree in its native soil.<br />&nbsp; But when I looked again, they were gone!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I searched for them, I could not find them!<p />&nbsp; Look at those who are honest and good,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a wonderful future awaits those who love peace.<br />&nbsp; But the rebellious will be destroyed;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have no future.<p />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> rescues the godly;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is their fortress in times of trouble.<br />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> helps them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rescuing them from the wicked.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saves them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they find shelter in him.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
