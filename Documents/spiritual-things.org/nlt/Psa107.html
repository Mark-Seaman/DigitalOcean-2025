Then speak out!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies.<br />&nbsp; For he has gathered the exiles from many lands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from east and west,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from north and south.<p />&nbsp; Some wandered in the wilderness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost and homeless.<br />&nbsp; Hungry and thirsty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they nearly died.<br />&nbsp; “L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, help!” they cried in their trouble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he rescued them from their distress.<br />&nbsp; He led them straight to safety,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a city where they could live.<br />&nbsp; Let them praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> for his great love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the wonderful things he has done for them.<br />&nbsp; For he satisfies the thirsty<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fills the hungry with good things.<p />&nbsp; Some sat in darkness and deepest gloom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imprisoned in iron chains of misery.<br />&nbsp; They rebelled against the words of God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scorning the counsel of the Most High.<br />&nbsp; That is why he broke them with hard labor;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fell, and no one was there to help them.<br />&nbsp; “L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, help!” they cried in their trouble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he saved them from their distress.<br />&nbsp; He led them from the darkness and deepest gloom;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he snapped their chains.<br />&nbsp; Let them praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> for his great love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the wonderful things he has done for them.<br />&nbsp; For he broke down their prison gates of bronze;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he cut apart their bars of iron.<p />&nbsp; Some were fools; they rebelled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and suffered for their sins.<br />&nbsp; They couldn’t stand the thought of food,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were knocking on death’s door.<br />&nbsp; “L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, help!” they cried in their trouble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he saved them from their distress.<br />&nbsp; He sent out his word and healed them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snatching them from the door of death.<br />&nbsp; Let them praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> for his great love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the wonderful things he has done for them.<br />&nbsp; Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sing joyfully about his glorious acts.<p />&nbsp; Some went off to sea in ships,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plying the trade routes of the world.<br />&nbsp; They, too, observed the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s power in action,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his impressive works on the deepest seas.<br />&nbsp; He spoke, and the winds rose,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stirring up the waves.<br />&nbsp; Their ships were tossed to the heavens<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and plunged again to the depths;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sailors cringed in terror.<br />&nbsp; They reeled and staggered like drunkards<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and were at their wits’ end.<br />&nbsp; “L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, help!” they cried in their trouble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he saved them from their distress.<br />&nbsp; He calmed the storm to a whisper<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stilled the waves.<br />&nbsp; What a blessing was that stillness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he brought them safely into harbor!<br />&nbsp; Let them praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> for his great love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the wonderful things he has done for them.<br />&nbsp; Let them exalt him publicly before the congregation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and before the leaders of the nation.<p />&nbsp; He changes rivers into deserts,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and springs of water into dry, thirsty land.<br />&nbsp; He turns the fruitful land into salty wastelands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the wickedness of those who live there.<br />&nbsp; But he also turns deserts into pools of water,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dry land into springs of water.<br />&nbsp; He brings the hungry to settle there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to build their cities.<br />&nbsp; They sow their fields, plant their vineyards,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and harvest their bumper crops.<br />&nbsp; How he blesses them!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raise large families there,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their herds of livestock increase.<p />&nbsp; When they decrease in number and become impoverished<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,<br />&nbsp; the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> pours contempt on their princes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causing them to wander in trackless wastelands.<br />&nbsp; But he rescues the poor from trouble<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and increases their families like flocks of sheep.<br />&nbsp; The godly will see these things and be glad,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the wicked are struck silent.<br />&nbsp; Those who are wise will take all this to heart;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will see in our history the faithful love of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.</p><p /></div>
