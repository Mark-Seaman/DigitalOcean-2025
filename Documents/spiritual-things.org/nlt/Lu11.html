As he finished, one of his disciples came to him and said, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“This is how you should pray:<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>“Father, may your name be kept holy.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>May your Kingdom come soon.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>  Give us each day the food we need,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>  and forgive us our sins,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>as we forgive those who sin against us.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>And don’t let us yield to temptation.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><p />&nbsp; Then, teaching them more about prayer, he used this story: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Suppose you went to a friend’s house at midnight, wanting to borrow three loaves of bread. You say to him,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>‘A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit, and I have nothing for him to eat.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And suppose he calls out from his bedroom, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is locked for the night, and my family and I are all in bed. I can’t help you.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But I tell you this—though he won’t do it for friendship’s sake, if you keep knocking long enough, he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“And so I tell you, keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You fathers—if your children ask<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> for a fish, do you give them a snake instead?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Or if they ask for an egg, do you give them a scorpion? Of course not!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.”</font><h5>Jesus and the Prince of Demons</h5>&nbsp; One day Jesus cast out a demon from a man who couldn’t speak, and when the demon was gone, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed,  but some of them said, “No wonder he can cast out demons. He gets his power from Satan,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> the prince of demons.”  Others, trying to test Jesus, demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.<p />&nbsp; He knew their thoughts, so he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A family splintered by feuding will fall apart.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You say I am empowered by Satan. But if Satan is divided and fighting against himself, how can his kingdom survive?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And if I am empowered by Satan, what about your own exorcists? They cast out demons, too, so they will condemn you for what you have said.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But if I am casting out demons by the power of God,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For when a strong man like Satan is fully armed and guards his palace, his possessions are safe—</font> <font class='woj' style='color:'>until someone even stronger attacks and overpowers him, strips him of his weapons, and carries off his belongings.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone who isn’t with me opposes me, and anyone who isn’t working with me is actually working against me.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“When an evil<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, ‘I will return to the person I came from.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before.”</font><p />&nbsp; As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, “God bless your mother—the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you!”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice.”</font><h5>The Sign of Jonah</h5>&nbsp; As the crowd pressed in on Jesus, he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“This evil generation keeps asking me to show them a miraculous sign. But the only sign I will give them is the sign of Jonah.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>What happened to him was a sign to the people of Nineveh that God had sent him. What happens to the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> will be a sign to these people that he was sent by God.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The queen of Sheba<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here—but you refuse to listen.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The people of Nineveh will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here—but you refuse to repent.</font><h5>Receiving the Light</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a basket.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where its light can be seen by all who enter the house.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. But when it is bad, your body is filled with darkness.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Make sure that the light you think you have is not actually darkness.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If you are filled with light, with no dark corners, then your whole life will be radiant, as though a floodlight were filling you with light.”</font><h5>Jesus Criticizes the Religious Leaders</h5>&nbsp; As Jesus was speaking, one of the Pharisees invited him home for a meal. So he went in and took his place at the table.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>  His host was amazed to see that he sat down to eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony required by Jewish custom.  Then the Lord said to him, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You Pharisees are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy—full of greed and wickedness!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Fools! Didn’t God make the inside as well as the outside?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So clean the inside by giving gifts to the poor, and you will be clean all over.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> but you ignore justice and the love of God. You should tithe, yes, but do not neglect the more important things.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you love to sit in the seats of honor in the synagogues and receive respectful greetings as you walk in the marketplaces.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Yes, what sorrow awaits you! For you are like hidden graves in a field. People walk over them without knowing the corruption they are stepping on.”</font><p />&nbsp; “Teacher,” said an expert in religious law, “you have insulted us, too, in what you just said.”<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Yes,”</font> said Jesus, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“what sorrow also awaits you experts in religious law! For you crush people with unbearable religious demands, and you never lift a finger to ease the burden.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>What sorrow awaits you! For you build monuments for the prophets your own ancestors killed long ago.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But in fact, you stand as witnesses who agree with what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you join in their crime by building the monuments!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>This is what God in his wisdom said about you:<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> ‘I will send prophets and apostles to them, but they will kill some and persecute the others.’</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“As a result, this generation will be held responsible for the murder of all God’s prophets from the creation of the world—</font> <font class='woj' style='color:'>from the murder of Abel to the murder of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, it will certainly be charged against this generation.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What sorrow awaits you experts in religious law! For you remove the key to knowledge from the people. You don’t enter the Kingdom yourselves, and you prevent others from entering.”</font><p />&nbsp; As Jesus was leaving, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees became hostile and tried to provoke him with many questions.  They wanted to trap him into saying something they could use against him.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
