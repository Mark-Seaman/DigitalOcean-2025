Then you can eat later.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do? Of course not.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In the same way, when you obey me you should say, ‘We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.’”</font><h5>Ten Healed of Leprosy</h5>&nbsp; As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria.  As he entered a village there, ten lepers stood at a distance,  crying out, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”<p />&nbsp; He looked at them and said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Go show yourselves to the priests.”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font> And as they went, they were cleansed of their leprosy.<p />&nbsp; One of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back to Jesus, shouting, “Praise God!”  He fell to the ground at Jesus’ feet, thanking him for what he had done. This man was a Samaritan.<p />&nbsp; Jesus asked, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Didn’t I heal ten men? Where are the other nine?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?”</font>  And Jesus said to the man, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Stand up and go. Your faith has healed you.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><h5>The Coming of the Kingdom</h5>&nbsp; One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, “When will the Kingdom of God come?”<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Kingdom of God can’t be detected by visible signs.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You won’t be able to say, ‘Here it is!’ or ‘It’s over there!’ For the Kingdom of God is already among you.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><p />&nbsp; Then he said to his disciples, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The time is coming when you will long to see the day when the Son of Man returns,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> but you won’t see it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>People will tell you, ‘Look, there is the Son of Man,’ or ‘Here he is,’ but don’t go out and follow them.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so it will be on the day when the Son of Man comes.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But first the Son of Man must suffer terribly<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and be rejected by this generation.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah’s day.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In those days, the people enjoyed banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat and the flood came and destroyed them all.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“And the world will be as it was in the days of Lot. People went about their daily business—eating and drinking, buying and selling, farming and building—</font> <font class='woj' style='color:'>until the morning Lot left Sodom. Then fire and burning sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Yes, it will be ‘business as usual’ right up to the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>On that day a person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack. A person out in the field must not return home.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Remember what happened to Lot’s wife!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If you cling to your life, you will lose it, and if you let your life go, you will save it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>That night two people will be asleep in one bed; one will be taken, the other left.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Two women will be grinding flour together at the mill; one will be taken, the other left.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><p />&nbsp; “Where will this happen, Lord?”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> the disciples asked.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate that the end is near.”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
