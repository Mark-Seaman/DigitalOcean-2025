A song to be sung on the Sabbath Day.</h5>&nbsp; It is good to give thanks to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to sing praises to the Most High.<br />&nbsp; It is good to proclaim your unfailing love in the morning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your faithfulness in the evening,<br />&nbsp; accompanied by the ten-stringed harp<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the melody of the lyre.<p />&nbsp; You thrill me, L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, with all you have done for me!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sing for joy because of what you have done.<br />&nbsp; O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, what great works you do!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how deep are your thoughts.<br />&nbsp; Only a simpleton would not know,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and only a fool would not understand this:<br />&nbsp; Though the wicked sprout like weeds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and evildoers flourish,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will be destroyed forever.<p />&nbsp; But you, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, will be exalted forever.<br />&nbsp; Your enemies, L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, will surely perish;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all evildoers will be scattered.<br />&nbsp; But you have made me as strong as a wild ox.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have anointed me with the finest oil.<br />&nbsp; My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ears have heard the defeat of my wicked opponents.<br />&nbsp; But the godly will flourish like palm trees<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grow strong like the cedars of Lebanon.<br />&nbsp; For they are transplanted to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s own house.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They flourish in the courts of our God.<br />&nbsp; Even in old age they will still produce fruit;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will remain vital and green.<br />&nbsp; They will declare, “The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> is just!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is my rock!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evil in him!”</p><p /></div>
