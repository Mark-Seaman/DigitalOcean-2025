A psalm of Asaph.</h5>&nbsp; O God, do not be silent!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be deaf.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not be quiet, O God.<br />&nbsp; Don’t you hear the uproar of your enemies?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t you see that your arrogant enemies are rising up?<br />&nbsp; They devise crafty schemes against your people;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they conspire against your precious ones.<br />&nbsp; “Come,” they say, “let us wipe out Israel as a nation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will destroy the very memory of its existence.”<br />&nbsp; Yes, this was their unanimous decision.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They signed a treaty as allies against you—<br />&nbsp; these Edomites and Ishmaelites;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moabites and Hagrites;<br />&nbsp; Gebalites, Ammonites, and Amalekites;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and people from Philistia and Tyre.<br />&nbsp; Assyria has joined them, too,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is allied with the descendants of Lot.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Interlude</i><br /><p />&nbsp; Do to them as you did to the Midianites<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River.<br />&nbsp; They were destroyed at Endor,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their decaying corpses fertilized the soil.<br />&nbsp; Let their mighty nobles die as Oreb and Zeeb did.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all their princes die like Zebah and Zalmunna,<br />&nbsp; for they said, “Let us seize for our own use<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these pasturelands of God!”<br />&nbsp; O my God, scatter them like tumbleweed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like chaff before the wind!<br />&nbsp; As a fire burns a forest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as a flame sets mountains ablaze,<br />&nbsp; chase them with your fierce storm;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrify them with your tempest.<br />&nbsp; Utterly disgrace them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until they submit to your name, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; Let them be ashamed and terrified forever.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them die in disgrace.<br />&nbsp; Then they will learn that you alone are called the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you alone are the Most High,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supreme over all the earth.</p><p /></div>
