For I have important things to tell you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything I say is right,<br />&nbsp; for I speak the truth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and detest every kind of deception.<br />&nbsp; My advice is wholesome.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing devious or crooked in it.<br />&nbsp; My words are plain to anyone with understanding,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear to those with knowledge.<br />&nbsp; Choose my instruction rather than silver,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and knowledge rather than pure gold.<br />&nbsp; For wisdom is far more valuable than rubies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing you desire can compare with it.<p />&nbsp; “I, Wisdom, live together with good judgment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know where to discover knowledge and discernment.<br />&nbsp; All who fear the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> will hate evil.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I hate pride and arrogance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corruption and perverse speech.<br />&nbsp; Common sense and success belong to me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insight and strength are mine.<br />&nbsp; Because of me, kings reign,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rulers make just decrees.<br />&nbsp; Rulers lead with my help,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nobles make righteous judgments.<p />&nbsp; “I love all who love me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who search will surely find me.<br />&nbsp; I have riches and honor,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as enduring wealth and justice.<br />&nbsp; My gifts are better than gold, even the purest gold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my wages better than sterling silver!<br />&nbsp; I walk in righteousness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in paths of justice.<br />&nbsp; Those who love me inherit wealth.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will fill their treasuries.<p />&nbsp; “The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> formed me from the beginning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before he created anything else.<br />&nbsp; I was appointed in ages past,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the very first, before the earth began.<br />&nbsp; I was born before the oceans were created,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the springs bubbled forth their waters.<br />&nbsp; Before the mountains were formed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the hills, I was born—<br />&nbsp; before he had made the earth and fields<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the first handfuls of soil.<br />&nbsp; I was there when he established the heavens,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he drew the horizon on the oceans.<br />&nbsp; I was there when he set the clouds above,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he established springs deep in the earth.<br />&nbsp; I was there when he set the limits of the seas,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they would not spread beyond their boundaries.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he marked off the earth’s foundations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was the architect at his side.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was his constant delight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoicing always in his presence.<br />&nbsp; And how happy I was with the world he created;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how I rejoiced with the human family!<p />&nbsp; “And so, my children,<sup></sup> listen to me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all who follow my ways are joyful.<br />&nbsp; Listen to my instruction and be wise.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t ignore it.<br />&nbsp; Joyful are those who listen to me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watching for me daily at my gates,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting for me outside my home!<br />&nbsp; For whoever finds me finds life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and receives favor from the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; But those who miss me injure themselves.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who hate me love death.”</p><p />
