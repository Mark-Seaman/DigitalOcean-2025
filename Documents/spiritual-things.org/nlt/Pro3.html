If you do this, you will live many years,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your life will be satisfying.<br />&nbsp; Never let loyalty and kindness leave you!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tie them around your neck as a reminder.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Write them deep within your heart.<br />&nbsp; Then you will find favor with both God and people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will earn a good reputation.<p />&nbsp; Trust in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> with all your heart;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not depend on your own understanding.<br />&nbsp; Seek his will in all you do,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will show you which path to take.<p />&nbsp; Don’t be impressed with your own wisdom.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, fear the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and turn away from evil.<br />&nbsp; Then you will have healing for your body<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and strength for your bones.<p />&nbsp; Honor the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> with your wealth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the best part of everything you produce.<br />&nbsp; Then he will fill your barns with grain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your vats will overflow with good wine.<p />&nbsp; My child, don’t reject the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s discipline,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and don’t be upset when he corrects you.<br />&nbsp; For the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> corrects those he loves,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights.<sup></sup><p />&nbsp; Joyful is the person who finds wisdom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one who gains understanding.<br />&nbsp; For wisdom is more profitable than silver,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her wages are better than gold.<br />&nbsp; Wisdom is more precious than rubies;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing you desire can compare with her.<br />&nbsp; She offers you long life in her right hand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and riches and honor in her left.<br />&nbsp; She will guide you down delightful paths;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all her ways are satisfying.<br />&nbsp; Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happy are those who hold her tightly.<p />&nbsp; By wisdom the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> founded the earth;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by understanding he created the heavens.<br />&nbsp; By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the dew settles beneath the night sky.<p />&nbsp; My child, don’t lose sight of common sense and discernment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hang on to them,<br />&nbsp; for they will refresh your soul.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are like jewels on a necklace.<br />&nbsp; They keep you safe on your way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your feet will not stumble.<br />&nbsp; You can go to bed without fear;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will lie down and sleep soundly.<br />&nbsp; You need not be afraid of sudden disaster<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the destruction that comes upon the wicked,<br />&nbsp; for the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> is your security.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap.<p />&nbsp; Do not withhold good from those who deserve it<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it’s in your power to help them.<br />&nbsp; If you can help your neighbor now, don’t say,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come back tomorrow, and then I’ll help you.”<p />&nbsp; Don’t plot harm against your neighbor,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for those who live nearby trust you.<br />&nbsp; Don’t pick a fight without reason,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when no one has done you harm.<p />&nbsp; Don’t envy violent people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or copy their ways.<br />&nbsp; Such wicked people are detestable to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he offers his friendship to the godly.<p />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> curses the house of the wicked,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he blesses the home of the upright.<p />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> mocks the mockers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is gracious to the humble.<sup></sup><p />&nbsp; The wise inherit honor,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but fools are put to shame!</p><p />
