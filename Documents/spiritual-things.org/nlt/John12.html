A dinner was prepared in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those who ate<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> with him.  Then Mary took a twelve-ounce jar<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> of expensive perfume made from essence of nard, and she anointed Jesus’ feet with it, wiping his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance.<p />&nbsp; But Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would soon betray him, said,  “That perfume was worth a year’s wages.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> It should have been sold and the money given to the poor.”  Not that he cared for the poor—he was a thief, and since he was in charge of the disciples’ money, he often stole some for himself.<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Leave her alone. She did this in preparation for my burial.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.”</font><p />&nbsp; When all the people<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> heard of Jesus’ arrival, they flocked to see him and also to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead.  Then the leading priests decided to kill Lazarus, too,  for it was because of him that many of the people had deserted them<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and believed in Jesus.<h5>Jesus’ Triumphant Entry</h5>&nbsp; The next day, the news that Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem swept through the city. A large crowd of Passover visitors  took palm branches and went down the road to meet him. They shouted, <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Praise God!<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail to the King of Israel!”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it, fulfilling the prophecy that said:<p />&nbsp; “Don’t be afraid, people of Jerusalem.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, your King is coming,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riding on a donkey’s colt.”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; His disciples didn’t understand at the time that this was a fulfillment of prophecy. But after Jesus entered into his glory, they remembered what had happened and realized that these things had been written about him.<p />&nbsp; Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb, raising him from the dead, and they were telling others<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> about it.  That was the reason so many went out to meet him—because they had heard about this miraculous sign.  Then the Pharisees said to each other, “There’s nothing we can do. Look, everyone<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> has gone after him!”<h5>Jesus Predicts His Death</h5>&nbsp; Some Greeks who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration  paid a visit to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, “Sir, we want to meet Jesus.”  Philip told Andrew about it, and they went together to ask Jesus.<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Now the time has come for the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> to enter into his glory.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies, it remains alone. But its death will produce many new kernels—a plentiful harvest of new lives.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Those who love their life in this world will lose it. Those who care nothing for their life in this world will keep it for eternity.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Anyone who wants to be my disciple must follow me, because my servants must be where I am. And the Father will honor anyone who serves me.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Now my soul is deeply troubled. Should I pray, ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But this is the very reason I came!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Father, bring glory to your name.”</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a voice spoke from heaven, saying, “I have already brought glory to my name, and I will do so again.”  When the crowd heard the voice, some thought it was thunder, while others declared an angel had spoken to him.<p />&nbsp; Then Jesus told them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The voice was for your benefit, not mine.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The time for judging this world has come, when Satan, the ruler of this world, will be cast out.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself.”</font>  He said this to indicate how he was going to die.<p />&nbsp; The crowd responded, “We understood from Scripture<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> that the Messiah would live forever. How can you say the Son of Man will die? Just who is this Son of Man, anyway?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“My light will shine for you just a little longer. Walk in the light while you can, so the darkness will not overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness cannot see where they are going.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Put your trust in the light while there is still time; then you will become children of the light.”</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After saying these things, Jesus went away and was hidden from them.<h5>The Unbelief of the People</h5>&nbsp; But despite all the miraculous signs Jesus had done, most of the people still did not believe in him.  This is exactly what Isaiah the prophet had predicted: <p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, who has believed our message?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom has the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> revealed his powerful arm?”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; But the people couldn’t believe, for as Isaiah also said,<p />&nbsp; “The Lord has blinded their eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hardened their hearts—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that their eyes cannot see,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their hearts cannot understand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they cannot turn to me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have me heal them.”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; Isaiah was referring to Jesus when he said this, because he saw the future and spoke of the Messiah’s glory.  Many people did believe in him, however, including some of the Jewish leaders. But they wouldn’t admit it for fear that the Pharisees would expel them from the synagogue.  For they loved human praise more than the praise of God.<p />&nbsp; Jesus shouted to the crowds, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“If you trust me, you are trusting not only me, but also God who sent me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For when you see me, you are seeing the one who sent me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I have come as a light to shine in this dark world, so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I will not judge those who hear me but don’t obey me, for I have come to save the world and not to judge it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But all who reject me and my message will be judged on the day of judgment by the truth I have spoken.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I don’t speak on my own authority. The Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to say it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And I know his commands lead to eternal life; so I say whatever the Father tells me to say.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
