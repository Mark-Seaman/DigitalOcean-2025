You are dressed in a robe of light.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You make the clouds your chariot;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you ride upon the wings of the wind.<br />&nbsp; The winds are your messengers;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flames of fire are your servants.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; You placed the world on its foundation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so it would never be moved.<br />&nbsp; You clothed the earth with floods of water,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water that covered even the mountains.<br />&nbsp; At your command, the water fled;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the sound of your thunder, it hurried away.<br />&nbsp; Mountains rose and valleys sank<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the levels you decreed.<br />&nbsp; Then you set a firm boundary for the seas,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they would never again cover the earth.<p />&nbsp; You make springs pour water into the ravines,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so streams gush down from the mountains.<br />&nbsp; They provide water for all the animals,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the wild donkeys quench their thirst.<br />&nbsp; The birds nest beside the streams<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sing among the branches of the trees.<br />&nbsp; You send rain on the mountains from your heavenly home,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you fill the earth with the fruit of your labor.<br />&nbsp; You cause grass to grow for the livestock<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and plants for people to use.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You allow them to produce food from the earth—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wine to make them glad,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;olive oil to soothe their skin,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bread to give them strength.<br />&nbsp; The trees of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> are well cared for—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.<br />&nbsp; There the birds make their nests,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the storks make their homes in the cypresses.<br />&nbsp; High in the mountains live the wild goats,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rocks form a refuge for the hyraxes.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; You made the moon to mark the seasons,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sun knows when to set.<br />&nbsp; You send the darkness, and it becomes night,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when all the forest animals prowl about.<br />&nbsp; Then the young lions roar for their prey,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stalking the food provided by God.<br />&nbsp; At dawn they slink back<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into their dens to rest.<br />&nbsp; Then people go off to their work,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where they labor until evening.<p />&nbsp; O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, what a variety of things you have made!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In wisdom you have made them all.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth is full of your creatures.<br />&nbsp; Here is the ocean, vast and wide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teeming with life of every kind,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both large and small.<br />&nbsp; See the ships sailing along,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Leviathan,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> which you made to play in the sea.<p />&nbsp; They all depend on you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to give them food as they need it.<br />&nbsp; When you supply it, they gather it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You open your hand to feed them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they are richly satisfied.<br />&nbsp; But if you turn away from them, they panic.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you take away their breath,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they die and turn again to dust.<br />&nbsp; When you give them your breath,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> life is created,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you renew the face of the earth.<p />&nbsp; May the glory of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> continue forever!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> takes pleasure in all he has made!<br />&nbsp; The earth trembles at his glance;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mountains smoke at his touch.<p />&nbsp; I will sing to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> as long as I live.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will praise my God to my last breath!<br />&nbsp; May all my thoughts be pleasing to him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I rejoice in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; Let all sinners vanish from the face of the earth;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the wicked disappear forever.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all that I am praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>!</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
