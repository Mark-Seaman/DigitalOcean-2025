Large crowds followed him there, and he healed their sick.<p />&nbsp; Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question: “Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife for just any reason?”<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Haven’t you read the Scriptures?”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“They record that from the beginning ‘God made them male and female.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And he said, ‘This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Since they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together.”</font><p />&nbsp; “Then why did Moses say in the law that a man could give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away?”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> they asked.<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Moses permitted divorce only as a concession to your hard hearts, but it was not what God had originally intended.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And I tell you this, whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery—unless his wife has been unfaithful.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><p />&nbsp; Jesus’ disciples then said to him, “If this is the case, it is better not to marry!”<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Not everyone can accept this statement,”</font> Jesus said. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Only those whom God helps.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Some are born as eunuchs, some have been made eunuchs by others, and some choose not to marry<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.”</font><h5>Jesus Blesses the Children</h5>&nbsp; One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.<p />&nbsp; But Jesus said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Let the children come to me. Don’t stop them! For the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those who are like these children.”</font>  And he placed his hands on their heads and blessed them before he left.<h5>The Rich Man</h5>&nbsp; Someone came to Jesus with this question: “Teacher,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> what good deed must I do to have eternal life?”<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Why ask me about what is good?”</font> Jesus replied. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“There is only One who is good. But to answer your question—if you want to receive eternal life, keep<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> the commandments.”</font><p />&nbsp; “Which ones?” the man asked.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jesus replied: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“‘You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Honor your father and mother. Love your neighbor as yourself.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><p />&nbsp; “I’ve obeyed all these commandments,” the young man replied. “What else must I do?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus told him, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“If you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</font><p />&nbsp; But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.<p />&nbsp; Then Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you the truth, it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I’ll say it again—it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!”</font><p />&nbsp; The disciples were astounded. “Then who in the world can be saved?” they asked.<p />&nbsp; Jesus looked at them intently and said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But with God everything is possible.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then Peter said to him, “We’ve given up everything to follow you. What will we get?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I assure you that when the world is made new<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> sits upon his glorious throne, you who have been my followers will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for my sake, will receive a hundred times as much in return and will inherit eternal life.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
