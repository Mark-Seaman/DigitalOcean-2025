We have acted wickedly!<br />&nbsp; Our ancestors in Egypt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were not impressed by the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s miraculous deeds.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They soon forgot his many acts of kindness to them.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp; Even so, he saved them—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to defend the honor of his name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to demonstrate his mighty power.<br />&nbsp; He commanded the Red Sea<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> to dry up.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led Israel across the sea as if it were a desert.<br />&nbsp; So he rescued them from their enemies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and redeemed them from their foes.<br />&nbsp; Then the water returned and covered their enemies;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one of them survived.<br />&nbsp; Then his people believed his promises.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they sang his praise.<p />&nbsp; Yet how quickly they forgot what he had done!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They wouldn’t wait for his counsel!<br />&nbsp; In the wilderness their desires ran wild,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testing God’s patience in that dry wasteland.<br />&nbsp; So he gave them what they asked for,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he sent a plague along with it.<br />&nbsp; The people in the camp were jealous of Moses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and envious of Aaron, the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s holy priest.<br />&nbsp; Because of this, the earth opened up;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it swallowed Dathan<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and buried Abiram and the other rebels.<br />&nbsp; Fire fell upon their followers;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a flame consumed the wicked.<p />&nbsp; The people made a calf at Mount Sinai<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they bowed before an image made of gold.<br />&nbsp; They traded their glorious God<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a statue of a grass-eating bull.<br />&nbsp; They forgot God, their savior,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who had done such great things in Egypt—<br />&nbsp; such wonderful things in the land of Ham,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such awesome deeds at the Red Sea.<br />&nbsp; So he declared he would destroy them.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Moses, his chosen one, stepped between the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and the people.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He begged him to turn from his anger and not destroy them.<p />&nbsp; The people refused to enter the pleasant land,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they wouldn’t believe his promise to care for them.<br />&nbsp; Instead, they grumbled in their tents<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refused to obey the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; Therefore, he solemnly swore<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he would kill them in the wilderness,<br />&nbsp; that he would scatter their descendants among the nations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exiling them to distant lands.<p />&nbsp; Then our ancestors joined in the worship of Baal at Peor;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they even ate sacrifices offered to the dead!<br />&nbsp; They angered the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> with all these things,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a plague broke out among them.<br />&nbsp; But Phinehas had the courage to intervene,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the plague was stopped.<br />&nbsp; So he has been regarded as a righteous man<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever since that time.<p />&nbsp; At Meribah, too, they angered the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causing Moses serious trouble.<br />&nbsp; They made Moses angry,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he spoke foolishly.<p />&nbsp; Israel failed to destroy the nations in the land,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> had commanded them.<br />&nbsp; Instead, they mingled among the pagans<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and adopted their evil customs.<br />&nbsp; They worshiped their idols,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which led to their downfall.<br />&nbsp; They even sacrificed their sons<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their daughters to the demons.<br />&nbsp; They shed innocent blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blood of their sons and daughters.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they polluted the land with murder.<br />&nbsp; They defiled themselves by their evil deeds,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their love of idols was adultery in the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s sight.<p />&nbsp; That is why the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s anger burned against his people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he abhorred his own special possession.<br />&nbsp; He handed them over to pagan nations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were ruled by those who hated them.<br />&nbsp; Their enemies crushed them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brought them under their cruel power.<br />&nbsp; Again and again he rescued them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they chose to rebel against him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were finally destroyed by their sin.<br />&nbsp; Even so, he pitied them in their distress<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and listened to their cries.<br />&nbsp; He remembered his covenant with them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and relented because of his unfailing love.<br />&nbsp; He even caused their captors<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to treat them with kindness.<p />&nbsp; Save us, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> our God!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather us back from among the nations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so we can thank your holy name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rejoice and praise you.<p />&nbsp; Praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, the God of Israel,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who lives from everlasting to everlasting!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all the people say, “Amen!”<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>!</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
