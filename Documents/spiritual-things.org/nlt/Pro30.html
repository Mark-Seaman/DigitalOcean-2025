I am too stupid to be human,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I lack common sense.<br />&nbsp; I have not mastered human wisdom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor do I know the Holy One.<p />&nbsp; Who but God goes up to heaven and comes back down?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who holds the wind in his fists?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wraps up the oceans in his cloak?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has created the whole wide world?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is his name—and his son’s name?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me if you know!<p />&nbsp; Every word of God proves true.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a shield to all who come to him for protection.<br />&nbsp; Do not add to his words,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or he may rebuke you and expose you as a liar.<p />&nbsp; O God, I beg two favors from you;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me have them before I die.<br />&nbsp; First, help me never to tell a lie.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, give me neither poverty nor riches!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.<br />&nbsp; For if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, “Who is the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>?”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God’s holy name.<p />&nbsp; Never slander a worker to the employer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the person will curse you, and you will pay for it.<p />&nbsp; Some people curse their father<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not thank their mother.<br />&nbsp; They are pure in their own eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are filthy and unwashed.<br />&nbsp; They look proudly around,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casting disdainful glances.<br />&nbsp; They have teeth like swords<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fangs like knives.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They devour the poor from the earth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the needy from among humanity.<p />&nbsp; The leech has two suckers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that cry out, “More, more!”<sup></sup><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three things that are never satisfied—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no, four that never say, “Enough!”:<br />&nbsp; the grave,<sup></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the barren womb,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thirsty desert,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blazing fire.<p />&nbsp; The eye that mocks a father<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and despises a mother’s instructions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be plucked out by ravens of the valley<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and eaten by vultures.<p />&nbsp; There are three things that amaze me—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no, four things that I don’t understand:<br />&nbsp; how an eagle glides through the sky,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how a snake slithers on a rock,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how a ship navigates the ocean,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how a man loves a woman.<p />&nbsp; An adulterous woman consumes a man,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then wipes her mouth and says, “What’s wrong with that?”<p />&nbsp; There are three things that make the earth tremble—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no, four it cannot endure:<br />&nbsp; a slave who becomes a king,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an overbearing fool who prospers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a bitter woman who finally gets a husband,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a servant girl who supplants her mistress.<p />&nbsp; There are four things on earth that are small but unusually wise:<br />&nbsp; Ants—they aren’t strong,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they store up food all summer.<br />&nbsp; Hyraxes<sup></sup>—they aren’t powerful,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they make their homes among the rocks.<br />&nbsp; Locusts—they have no king,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they march in formation.<br />&nbsp; Lizards—they are easy to catch,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are found even in kings’ palaces.<p />&nbsp; There are three things that walk with stately stride—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no, four that strut about:<br />&nbsp; the lion, king of animals, who won’t turn aside for anything,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the strutting rooster,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the male goat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a king as he leads his army.<p />&nbsp; If you have been a fool by being proud or plotting evil,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cover your mouth in shame.<p />&nbsp; As the beating of cream yields butter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and striking the nose causes bleeding,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so stirring up anger causes quarrels.</p><p />
