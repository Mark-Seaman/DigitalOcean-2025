Here are the names of the twelve apostles:<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first, Simon (also called Peter),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then Andrew (Peter’s brother),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James (son of Zebedee),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John (James’s brother),<br />&nbsp; Philip,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartholomew,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew (the tax collector),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James (son of Alphaeus),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaddaeus,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp; Simon (the zealot<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).<p />&nbsp; Jesus sent out the twelve apostles with these instructions: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t go to the Gentiles or the Samaritans,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>but only to the people of Israel—God’s lost sheep.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Go and announce to them that the Kingdom of Heaven is near.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Heal the sick, raise the dead, cure those with leprosy, and cast out demons. Give as freely as you have received!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t take any money in your money belts—no gold, silver, or even copper coins.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Don’t carry a traveler’s bag with a change of clothes and sandals or even a walking stick. Don’t hesitate to accept hospitality, because those who work deserve to be fed.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Whenever you enter a city or village, search for a worthy person and stay in his home until you leave town.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When you enter the home, give it your blessing.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If it turns out to be a worthy home, let your blessing stand; if it is not, take back the blessing.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If any household or town refuses to welcome you or listen to your message, shake its dust from your feet as you leave.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you the truth, the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah will be better off than such a town on the judgment day.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Look, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes and harmless as doves.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But beware! For you will be handed over to the courts and will be flogged with whips in the synagogues.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell the rulers and other unbelievers about me.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When you are arrested, don’t worry about how to respond or what to say. God will give you the right words at the right time.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For it is not you who will be speaking—it will be the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“A brother will betray his brother to death, a father will betray his own child, and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And all nations will hate you because you are my followers.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> But everyone who endures to the end will be saved.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When you are persecuted in one town, flee to the next. I tell you the truth, the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> will return before you have reached all the towns of Israel.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Students<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> are not greater than their teacher, and slaves are not greater than their master.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Students are to be like their teacher, and slaves are to be like their master. And since I, the master of the household, have been called the prince of demons,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> the members of my household will be called by even worse names!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But don’t be afraid of those who threaten you. For the time is coming when everything that is covered will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>What I tell you now in the darkness, shout abroad when daybreak comes. What I whisper in your ear, shout from the housetops for all to hear!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot touch your soul. Fear only God, who can destroy both soul and body in hell.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>What is the price of two sparrows—one copper coin<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>? But not a single sparrow can fall to the ground without your Father knowing it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And the very hairs on your head are all numbered.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So don’t be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Everyone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But everyone who denies me here on earth, I will also deny before my Father in heaven.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t imagine that I came to bring peace to the earth!
