I didn’t tell you earlier because I was going to be with you for a while longer.</font><h5>The Work of the Holy Spirit</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But now I am going away to the One who sent me, and not one of you is asking where I am going.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Instead, you grieve because of what I’ve told you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But in fact, it is best for you that I go away, because if I don’t, the Advocate<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> won’t come. If I do go away, then I will send him to you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And when he comes, he will convict the world of its sin, and of God’s righteousness, and of the coming judgment.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The world’s sin is that it refuses to believe in me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Righteousness is available because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Judgment will come because the ruler of this world has already been judged.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“There is so much more I want to tell you, but you can’t bear it now.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>He will bring me glory by telling you whatever he receives from me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>All that belongs to the Father is mine; this is why I said, ‘The Spirit will tell you whatever he receives from me.’</font><h5>Sadness Will Be Turned to Joy</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“In a little while you won’t see me anymore. But a little while after that, you will see me again.”</font><p />&nbsp; Some of the disciples asked each other, “What does he mean when he says, ‘In a little while you won’t see me, but then you will see me,’ and ‘I am going to the Father’?  And what does he mean by ‘a little while’? We don’t understand.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus realized they wanted to ask him about it, so he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Are you asking yourselves what I meant? I said in a little while you won’t see me, but a little while after that you will see me again.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn over what is going to happen to me, but the world will rejoice. You will grieve, but your grief will suddenly turn to wonderful joy.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>It will be like a woman suffering the pains of labor. When her child is born, her anguish gives way to joy because she has brought a new baby into the world.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again; then you will rejoice, and no one can rob you of that joy.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>At that time you won’t need to ask me for anything. I tell you the truth, you will ask the Father directly, and he will grant your request because you use my name.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You haven’t done this before. Ask, using my name, and you will receive, and you will have abundant joy.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I have spoken of these matters in figures of speech, but soon I will stop speaking figuratively and will tell you plainly all about the Father.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then you will ask in my name. I’m not saying I will ask the Father on your behalf,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>for the Father himself loves you dearly because you love me and believe that I came from God.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Yes, I came from the Father into the world, and now I will leave the world and return to the Father.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then his disciples said, “At last you are speaking plainly and not figuratively.  Now we understand that you know everything, and there’s no need to question you. From this we believe that you came from God.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus asked, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Do you finally believe?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But the time is coming—indeed it’s here now—when you will be scattered, each one going his own way, leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
