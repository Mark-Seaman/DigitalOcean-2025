I, too, am an elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ. And I, too, will share in his glory when he is revealed to the whole world. As a fellow elder, I appeal to you:  Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you. Watch over it willingly, not grudgingly—not for what you will get out of it, but because you are eager to serve God.  Don’t lord it over the people assigned to your care, but lead them by your own good example.  And when the Great Shepherd appears, you will receive a crown of never-ending glory and honor.<p />&nbsp; In the same way, you younger men must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you, serve each other in humility, for<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“God opposes the proud<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but favors the humble.”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp; So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor.  Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.<p />&nbsp; Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.  Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your Christian brothers and sisters<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> all over the world are going through the same kind of suffering you are.<p />&nbsp; In his kindness God called you to share in his eternal glory by means of Christ Jesus. So after you have suffered a little while, he will restore, support, and strengthen you, and he will place you on a firm foundation.  All power to him forever! Amen.<h5>Peter’s Final Greetings</h5>&nbsp; I have written and sent this short letter to you with the help of Silas,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> whom I commend to you as a faithful brother. My purpose in writing is to encourage you and assure you that what you are experiencing is truly part of God’s grace for you. Stand firm in this grace.<p />&nbsp; Your sister church here in Babylon<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> sends you greetings, and so does my son Mark.  Greet each other with Christian love.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace be with all of you who are in Christ.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
