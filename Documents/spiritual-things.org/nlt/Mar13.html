Look at the impressive stones in the walls.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Yes, look at these great buildings. But they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!”</font><p />&nbsp; Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives across the valley from the Temple. Peter, James, John, and Andrew came to him privately and asked him,  “Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will show us that these things are about to be fulfilled?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t let anyone mislead you,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>for many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> They will deceive many.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don’t panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won’t follow immediately.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many parts of the world, as well as famines. But this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“When these things begin to happen, watch out! You will be handed over to the local councils and beaten in the synagogues. You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For the Good News must first be preached to all nations.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But when you are arrested and stand trial, don’t worry in advance about what to say. Just say what God tells you at that time, for it is not you who will be speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“A brother will betray his brother to death, a father will betray his own child, and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And everyone will hate you because you are my followers.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> But the one who endures to the end will be saved.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The day is coming when you will see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> standing where he<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> should not be.”</font> (Reader, pay attention!) <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Then those in Judea must flee to the hills.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And pray that your flight will not be in winter.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For there will be greater anguish in those days than at any time since God created the world. And it will never be so great again.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In fact, unless the Lord shortens that time of calamity, not a single person will survive. But for the sake of his chosen ones he has shortened those days.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Messiah,’ or ‘There he is,’ don’t believe it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God’s chosen ones.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Watch out! I have warned you about this ahead of time!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“At that time, after the anguish of those days,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>the sun will be darkened,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>the moon will give no light,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'> the stars will fall from the sky,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then everyone will see the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> coming on the clouds with great power and glory.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And he will send out his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the world<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>—from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that his return is very near, right at the door.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you the truth, this generation<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> will not pass from the scene before all these things take place.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And since you don’t know when that time will come, be on guard! Stay alert<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The coming of the Son of Man can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip. When he left home, he gave each of his slaves instructions about the work they were to do, and he told the gatekeeper to watch for his return.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You, too, must keep watch! For you don’t know when the master of the household will return—in the evening, at midnight, before dawn, or at daybreak.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Don’t let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I say to you what I say to everyone: Watch for him!”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
