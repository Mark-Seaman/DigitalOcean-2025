Their purpose is to teach people wisdom and discipline,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to help them understand the insights of the wise.<br />&nbsp; Their purpose is to teach people to live disciplined and successful lives,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to help them do what is right, just, and fair.<br />&nbsp; These proverbs will give insight to the simple,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge and discernment to the young.<p />&nbsp; Let the wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let those with understanding receive guidance<br />&nbsp; by exploring the meaning in these proverbs and parables,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the words of the wise and their riddles.<p />&nbsp; Fear of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> is the foundation of true knowledge,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but fools despise wisdom and discipline.<h5>A Father’s Exhortation: Acquire Wisdom</h5>&nbsp; My child,<sup></sup> listen when your father corrects you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t neglect your mother’s instruction.<br />&nbsp; What you learn from them will crown you with grace<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be a chain of honor around your neck.<p />&nbsp; My child, if sinners entice you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn your back on them!<br />&nbsp; They may say, “Come and join us.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let’s hide and kill someone!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for fun, let’s ambush the innocent!<br />&nbsp; Let’s swallow them alive, like the grave<sup></sup>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let’s swallow them whole, like those who go down to the pit of death.<br />&nbsp; Think of the great things we’ll get!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll fill our houses with all the stuff we take.<br />&nbsp; Come, throw in your lot with us;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we’ll all share the loot.”<p />&nbsp; My child, don’t go along with them!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay far away from their paths.<br />&nbsp; They rush to commit evil deeds.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hurry to commit murder.<br />&nbsp; If a bird sees a trap being set,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it knows to stay away.<br />&nbsp; But these people set an ambush for themselves;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are trying to get themselves killed.<br />&nbsp; Such is the fate of all who are greedy for money;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it robs them of life.<h5>Wisdom Shouts in the Streets</h5>&nbsp; Wisdom shouts in the streets.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cries out in the public square.<br />&nbsp; She calls to the crowds along the main street,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those gathered in front of the city gate:<br />&nbsp; “How long, you simpletons,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will you insist on being simpleminded?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long will you mockers relish your mocking?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long will you fools hate knowledge?<br />&nbsp; Come and listen to my counsel.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll share my heart with you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make you wise.<p />&nbsp; “I called you so often, but you wouldn’t come.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reached out to you, but you paid no attention.<br />&nbsp; You ignored my advice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rejected the correction I offered.<br />&nbsp; So I will laugh when you are in trouble!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will mock you when disaster overtakes you—<br />&nbsp; when calamity overtakes you like a storm,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when disaster engulfs you like a cyclone,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and anguish and distress overwhelm you.<p />&nbsp; “When they cry for help, I will not answer.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me.<br />&nbsp; For they hated knowledge<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and chose not to fear the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; They rejected my advice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and paid no attention when I corrected them.<br />&nbsp; Therefore, they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choking on their own schemes.<br />&nbsp; For simpletons turn away from me—to death.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fools are destroyed by their own complacency.<br />&nbsp; But all who listen to me will live in peace,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;untroubled by fear of harm.”</p><p />
