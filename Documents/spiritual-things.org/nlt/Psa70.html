We’ve got him now!”<br />&nbsp; But may all who search for you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be filled with joy and gladness in you.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May those who love your salvation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeatedly shout, “God is great!”<br />&nbsp; But as for me, I am poor and needy;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;please hurry to my aid, O God.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are my helper and my savior;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, do not delay.</p><p /></div>
