Save me, O God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the floodwaters are up to my neck.<br />&nbsp; Deeper and deeper I sink into the mire;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can’t find a foothold.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in deep water,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the floods overwhelm me.<br />&nbsp; I am exhausted from crying for help;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my throat is parched.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My eyes are swollen with weeping,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting for my God to help me.<br />&nbsp; Those who hate me without cause<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outnumber the hairs on my head.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many enemies try to destroy me with lies,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demanding that I give back what I didn’t steal.<p />&nbsp; O God, you know how foolish I am;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my sins cannot be hidden from you.<br />&nbsp; Don’t let those who trust in you be ashamed because of me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Sovereign L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> of Heaven’s Armies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t let me cause them to be humiliated,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God of Israel.<br />&nbsp; For I endure insults for your sake;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humiliation is written all over my face.<br />&nbsp; Even my own brothers pretend they don’t know me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they treat me like a stranger.<p />&nbsp; Passion for your house has consumed me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.<br />&nbsp; When I weep and fast,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they scoff at me.<br />&nbsp; When I dress in burlap to show sorrow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they make fun of me.<br />&nbsp; I am the favorite topic of town gossip,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the drunks sing about me.<p />&nbsp; But I keep praying to you, L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hoping this time you will show me favor.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In your unfailing love, O God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer my prayer with your sure salvation.<br />&nbsp; Rescue me from the mud;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don’t let me sink any deeper!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save me from those who hate me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pull me from these deep waters.<br />&nbsp; Don’t let the floods overwhelm me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the deep waters swallow me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the pit of death devour me.<p />&nbsp; Answer my prayers, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your unfailing love is wonderful.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take care of me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for your mercy is so plentiful.<br />&nbsp; Don’t hide from your servant;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer me quickly, for I am in deep trouble!<br />&nbsp; Come and redeem me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free me from my enemies.<p />&nbsp; You know of my shame, scorn, and disgrace.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see all that my enemies are doing.<br />&nbsp; Their insults have broken my heart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am in despair.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only one person would show some pity;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if only one would turn and comfort me.<br />&nbsp; But instead, they give me poison<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> for food;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they offer me sour wine for my thirst.<p />&nbsp; Let the bountiful table set before them become a snare<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their prosperity become a trap.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp; Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make their bodies shake continually.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp; Pour out your fury on them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consume them with your burning anger.<br />&nbsp; Let their homes become desolate<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their tents be deserted.<br />&nbsp; To the one you have punished, they add insult to injury;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they add to the pain of those you have hurt.<br />&nbsp; Pile their sins up high,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and don’t let them go free.<br />&nbsp; Erase their names from the Book of Life;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don’t let them be counted among the righteous.<p />&nbsp; I am suffering and in pain.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescue me, O God, by your saving power.<p />&nbsp; Then I will praise God’s name with singing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will honor him with thanksgiving.<br />&nbsp; For this will please the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> more than sacrificing cattle,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than presenting a bull with its horns and hooves.<br />&nbsp; The humble will see their God at work and be glad.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let all who seek God’s help be encouraged.<br />&nbsp; For the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> hears the cries of the needy;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not despise his imprisoned people.<p />&nbsp; Praise him, O heaven and earth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the seas and all that move in them.<br />&nbsp; For God will save Jerusalem<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rebuild the towns of Judah.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His people will live there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and settle in their own land.<br />&nbsp; The descendants of those who obey him will inherit the land,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who love him will live there in safety.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
