A psalm of David.</h5>&nbsp; How wonderful and pleasant it is<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when brothers live together in harmony!<br />&nbsp; For harmony is as precious as the anointing oil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was poured over Aaronâ€™s head,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that ran down his beard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and onto the border of his robe.<br />&nbsp; Harmony is as refreshing as the dew from Mount Hermon<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that falls on the mountains of Zion.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> has pronounced his blessing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even life everlasting.</p><p /></div>
