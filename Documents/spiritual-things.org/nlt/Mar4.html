A very large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat in the boat while all the people remained on the shore.  He taught them by telling many stories in the form of parables, such as this one:<p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seed.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>As he scattered it across his field, some of the seed fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But the plant soon wilted under the hot sun, and since it didn’t have deep roots, it died.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Other seed fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants so they produced no grain.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they sprouted, grew, and produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”</font>  Then he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.”</font><p />&nbsp; Later, when Jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around, they asked him what the parables meant.<p />&nbsp; He replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You are permitted to understand the secret<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables for everything I say to outsiders,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled:</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>‘When they see what I do,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>they will learn nothing.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>When they hear what I say,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>they will not understand.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>Otherwise, they will turn to me</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and be forgiven.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><p />&nbsp; Then Jesus said to them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“If you can’t understand the meaning of this parable, how will you understand all the other parables?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The farmer plants seed by taking God’s word to others.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message, only to have Satan come at once and take it away.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But since they don’t have deep roots, they don’t last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God’s word.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The seed that fell among the thorns represents others who hear God’s word,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things, so no fruit is produced.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”</font><h5>Parable of the Lamp</h5>&nbsp; Then Jesus asked them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Would anyone light a lamp and then put it under a basket or under a bed? Of course not! A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light will shine.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then he added, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Pay close attention to what you hear. The closer you listen, the more understanding you will be given<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>—and you will receive even more.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them.”</font><h5>Parable of the Growing Seed</h5>&nbsp; Jesus also said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Kingdom of God is like a farmer who scatters seed on the ground.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Night and day, while he’s asleep or awake, the seed sprouts and grows, but he does not understand how it happens.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The earth produces the crops on its own. First a leaf blade pushes through, then the heads of wheat are formed, and finally the grain ripens.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And as soon as the grain is ready, the farmer comes and harvests it with a sickle, for the harvest time has come.”</font><h5>Parable of the Mustard Seed</h5>&nbsp; Jesus said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“How can I describe the Kingdom of God? What story should I use to illustrate it?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>but it becomes the largest of all garden plants; it grows long branches, and birds can make nests in its shade.”</font><p />&nbsp; Jesus used many similar stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand.  In fact, in his public ministry he never taught without using parables; but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.<h5>Jesus Calms the Storm</h5>&nbsp; As evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Let’s cross to the other side of the lake.”</font>  So they took Jesus in the boat and started out, leaving the crowds behind (although other boats followed).  But soon a fierce storm came up. High waves were breaking into the boat, and it began to fill with water.<p />&nbsp; Jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to drown?”<p />&nbsp; When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the waves, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Silence! Be still!”</font> Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm.  Then he asked them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?”</font><p />&nbsp; The disciples were absolutely terrified. “Who is this man?” they asked each other. “Even the wind and waves obey him!”</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
