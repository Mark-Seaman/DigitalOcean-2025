Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You have so little faith! Why are you arguing with each other about having no bread?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Don’t you understand even yet? Don’t you remember the 5,000 I fed with five loaves, and the baskets of leftovers you picked up?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Or the 4,000 I fed with seven loaves, and the large baskets of leftovers you picked up?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Why can’t you understand that I’m not talking about bread? So again I say, ‘Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’”</font><p />&nbsp; Then at last they understood that he wasn’t speaking about the yeast in bread, but about the deceptive teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<h5>Peter’s Declaration about Jesus</h5>&nbsp; When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; “Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets.”<p />&nbsp; Then he asked them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But who do you say I am?”</font><p />&nbsp; Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> the Son of the living God.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You are blessed, Simon son of John,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> because my Father in heaven has revealed this to you. You did not learn this from any human being.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Now I say to you that you are Peter (which means ‘rock’),<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> will not conquer it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you forbid<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> on earth will be permitted in heaven.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then he sternly warned the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.<h5>Jesus Predicts His Death</h5>&nbsp; From then on Jesus<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> began to tell his disciples plainly that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem, and that he would suffer many terrible things at the hands of the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised from the dead.<p />&nbsp; But Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> for saying such things. “Heaven forbid, Lord,” he said. “This will never happen to you!”<p />&nbsp; Jesus turned to Peter and said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Get away from me, Satan! You are a dangerous trap to me. You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God’s.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then Jesus said to his disciples, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“If any of you wants to be my follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> Is anything worth more than your soul?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father and will judge all people according to their deeds.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And I tell you the truth, some standing here right now will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
