He sang this song to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> on the day the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> rescued him from all his enemies and from Saul. He sang:</h5>&nbsp; I love you, L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are my strength.<br />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> is my rock, my fortress, and my savior;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my God is my rock, in whom I find protection.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is my shield, the power that saves me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my place of safety.<br />&nbsp; I called on the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, who is worthy of praise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he saved me from my enemies.<p />&nbsp; The ropes of death entangled me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;floods of destruction swept over me.<br />&nbsp; The grave<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> wrapped its ropes around me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death laid a trap in my path.<br />&nbsp; But in my distress I cried out to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, I prayed to my God for help.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard me from his sanctuary;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my cry to him reached his ears.<p />&nbsp; Then the earth quaked and trembled.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foundations of the mountains shook;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they quaked because of his anger.<br />&nbsp; Smoke poured from his nostrils;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fierce flames leaped from his mouth.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glowing coals blazed forth from him.<br />&nbsp; He opened the heavens and came down;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dark storm clouds were beneath his feet.<br />&nbsp; Mounted on a mighty angelic being,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> he flew,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soaring on the wings of the wind.<br />&nbsp; He shrouded himself in darkness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;veiling his approach with dark rain clouds.<br />&nbsp; Thick clouds shielded the brightness around him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rained down hail and burning coals.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> thundered from heaven;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the voice of the Most High resounded<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amid the hail and burning coals.<br />&nbsp; He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his lightning flashed, and they were greatly confused.<br />&nbsp; Then at your command, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the blast of your breath,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bottom of the sea could be seen,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the foundations of the earth were laid bare.<p />&nbsp; He reached down from heaven and rescued me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he drew me out of deep waters.<br />&nbsp; He rescued me from my powerful enemies,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from those who hated me and were too strong for me.<br />&nbsp; They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> supported me.<br />&nbsp; He led me to a place of safety;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he rescued me because he delights in me.<br />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> rewarded me for doing right;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he restored me because of my innocence.<br />&nbsp; For I have kept the ways of the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not turned from my God to follow evil.<br />&nbsp; I have followed all his regulations;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never abandoned his decrees.<br />&nbsp; I am blameless before God;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have kept myself from sin.<br />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> rewarded me for doing right.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has seen my innocence.<p />&nbsp; To the faithful you show yourself faithful;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those with integrity you show integrity.<br />&nbsp; To the pure you show yourself pure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but to the wicked you show yourself hostile.<br />&nbsp; You rescue the humble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you humiliate the proud.<br />&nbsp; You light a lamp for me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, my God, lights up my darkness.<br />&nbsp; In your strength I can crush an army;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my God I can scale any wall.<p />&nbsp; God’s way is perfect.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s promises prove true.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a shield for all who look to him for protection.<br />&nbsp; For who is God except the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who but our God is a solid rock?<br />&nbsp; God arms me with strength,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he makes my way perfect.<br />&nbsp; He makes me as surefooted as a deer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enabling me to stand on mountain heights.<br />&nbsp; He trains my hands for battle;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.<br />&nbsp; You have given me your shield of victory.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your right hand supports me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your help has made me great.<br />&nbsp; You have made a wide path for my feet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep them from slipping.<p />&nbsp; I chased my enemies and caught them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not stop until they were conquered.<br />&nbsp; I struck them down so they could not get up;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fell beneath my feet.<br />&nbsp; You have armed me with strength for the battle;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have subdued my enemies under my feet.<br />&nbsp; You placed my foot on their necks.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have destroyed all who hated me.<br />&nbsp; They called for help, but no one came to their rescue.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They even cried to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, but he refused to answer.<br />&nbsp; I ground them as fine as dust in the wind.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I swept them into the gutter like dirt.<br />&nbsp; You gave me victory over my accusers.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You appointed me ruler over nations;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people I don’t even know now serve me.<br />&nbsp; As soon as they hear of me, they submit;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreign nations cringe before me.<br />&nbsp; They all lose their courage<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and come trembling from their strongholds.<p />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> lives! Praise to my Rock!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the God of my salvation be exalted!<br />&nbsp; He is the God who pays back those who harm me;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he subdues the nations under me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and rescues me from my enemies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you save me from violent opponents.<br />&nbsp; For this, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, I will praise you among the nations;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sing praises to your name.<br />&nbsp; You give great victories to your king;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you show unfailing love to your anointed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to David and all his descendants forever.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
