They should be obedient, always ready to do what is good.  They must not slander anyone and must avoid quarreling. Instead, they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone.<p />&nbsp; Once we, too, were foolish and disobedient. We were misled and became slaves to many lusts and pleasures. Our lives were full of evil and envy, and we hated each other.<p />&nbsp; But—“When God our Savior revealed his kindness and love,  he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>  He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior.  Because of his grace he declared us righteous and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life.”  This is a trustworthy saying, and I want you to insist on these teachings so that all who trust in God will devote themselves to doing good. These teachings are good and beneficial for everyone.<p />&nbsp; Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws. These things are useless and a waste of time.  If people are causing divisions among you, give a first and second warning. After that, have nothing more to do with them.  For people like that have turned away from the truth, and their own sins condemn them.<h5>Paul’s Final Remarks and Greetings</h5>&nbsp; I am planning to send either Artemas or Tychicus to you. As soon as one of them arrives, do your best to meet me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to stay there for the winter.  Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos with their trip. See that they are given everything they need.  Our people must learn to do good by meeting the urgent needs of others; then they will not be unproductive.<p />&nbsp; Everybody here sends greetings. Please give my greetings to the believers—all who love us.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May God’s grace be with you all.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
