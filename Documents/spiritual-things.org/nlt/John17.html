Glorify your Son so he can give glory back to you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For you have given him authority over everyone. He gives eternal life to each one you have given him.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And this is the way to have eternal life—to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, the one you sent to earth.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I brought glory to you here on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Now, Father, bring me into the glory we shared before the world began.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I have revealed you<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> to the ones you gave me from this world. They were always yours. You gave them to me, and they have kept your word.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Now they know that everything I have is a gift from you,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>for I have passed on to them the message you gave me. They accepted it and know that I came from you, and they believe you sent me.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“My prayer is not for the world, but for those you have given me, because they belong to you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>All who are mine belong to you, and you have given them to me, so they bring me glory.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Now I am departing from the world; they are staying in this world, but I am coming to you. Holy Father, you have given me your name;<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>During my time here, I protected them by the power of the name you gave me.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> I guarded them so that not one was lost, except the one headed for destruction, as the Scriptures foretold.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Now I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I have given them your word. And the world hates them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I’m not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them safe from the evil one.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>They do not belong to this world any more than I do.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is truth.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Just as you sent me into the world, I am sending them into the world.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And I give myself as a holy sacrifice for them so they can be made holy by your truth.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one—as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I have given them the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Father, I want these whom you have given me to be with me where I am. Then they can see all the glory you gave me because you loved me even before the world began!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“O righteous Father, the world doesn’t know you, but I do; and these disciples know you sent me.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I have revealed you to them, and I will continue to do so. Then your love for me will be in them, and I will be in them.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
