This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lampstands:</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don’t tolerate evil people. You have examined the claims of those who say they are apostles but are not. You have discovered they are liars.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>You have patiently suffered for me without quitting.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But I have this complaint against you. You don’t love me or each other as you did at first!<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Look how far you have fallen! Turn back to me and do the works you did at first. If you don’t repent, I will come and remove your lampstand from its place among the churches.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But this is in your favor: You hate the evil deeds of the Nicolaitans, just as I do.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will give fruit from the tree of life in the paradise of God.</font><h5>The Message to the Church in Smyrna</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Smyrna. This is the message from the one who is the First and the Last, who was dead but is now alive:</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I know about your suffering and your poverty—but you are rich! I know the blasphemy of those opposing you. They say they are Jews, but they are not, because their synagogue belongs to Satan.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil will throw some of you into prison to test you. You will suffer for ten days. But if you remain faithful even when facing death, I will give you the crown of life.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. Whoever is victorious will not be harmed by the second death.</font><h5>The Message to the Church in Pergamum</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Pergamum. This is the message from the one with the sharp two-edged sword:</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I know that you live in the city where Satan has his throne, yet you have remained loyal to me. You refused to deny me even when Antipas, my faithful witness, was martyred among you there in Satan’s city.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But I have a few complaints against you. You tolerate some among you whose teaching is like that of Balaam, who showed Balak how to trip up the people of Israel. He taught them to sin by eating food offered to idols and by committing sexual sin.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>In a similar way, you have some Nicolaitans among you who follow the same teaching.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Repent of your sin, or I will come to you suddenly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will give some of the manna that has been hidden away in heaven. And I will give to each one a white stone, and on the stone will be engraved a new name that no one understands except the one who receives it.</font><h5>The Message to the Church in Thyatira</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Write this letter to the angel of the church in Thyatira. This is the message from the Son of God, whose eyes are like flames of fire, whose feet are like polished bronze:</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I know all the things you do. I have seen your love, your faith, your service, and your patient endurance. And I can see your constant improvement in all these things.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But I have this complaint against you. You are permitting that woman—that Jezebel who calls herself a prophet—to lead my servants astray. She teaches them to commit sexual sin and to eat food offered to idols.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to turn away from her immorality.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Therefore, I will throw her on a bed of suffering,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly unless they repent and turn away from her evil deeds.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches out the thoughts and intentions of every person. And I will give to each of you whatever you deserve.</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But I also have a message for the rest of you in Thyatira who have not followed this false teaching (‘deeper truths,’ as they call them—depths of Satan, actually). I will ask nothing more of you</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>except that you hold tightly to what you have until I come.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>To all who are victorious, who obey me to the very end,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>To them I will give authority over all the nations.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'> They will rule the nations with an iron rod</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and smash them like clay pots.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>They will have the same authority I received from my Father, and I will also give them the morning star!</font><br />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
