Your unfailing love will last forever.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your faithfulness is as enduring as the heavens.<p />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> said, “I have made a covenant with David, my chosen servant.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sworn this oath to him:<br />&nbsp; ‘I will establish your descendants as kings forever;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will sit on your throne from now until eternity.’”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Interlude</i><br /><br />&nbsp; All heaven will praise your great wonders, L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myriads of angels will praise you for your faithfulness.<br />&nbsp; For who in all of heaven can compare with the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What mightiest angel is anything like the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>?<br />&nbsp; The highest angelic powers stand in awe of God.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is far more awesome than all who surround his throne.<br />&nbsp; O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> God of Heaven’s Armies!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is there anyone as mighty as you, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are entirely faithful.<p />&nbsp; You rule the oceans.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You subdue their storm-tossed waves.<br />&nbsp; You crushed the great sea monster.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.<br />&nbsp; The heavens are yours, and the earth is yours;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything in the world is yours—you created it all.<br />&nbsp; You created north and south.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon praise your name.<br />&nbsp; Powerful is your arm!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong is your hand!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your right hand is lifted high in glorious strength.<br />&nbsp; Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfailing love and truth walk before you as attendants.<br />&nbsp; Happy are those who hear the joyful call to worship,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they will walk in the light of your presence, L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; They rejoice all day long in your wonderful reputation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They exult in your righteousness.<br />&nbsp; You are their glorious strength.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It pleases you to make us strong.<br />&nbsp; Yes, our protection comes from the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he, the Holy One of Israel, has given us our king.<p />&nbsp; Long ago you spoke in a vision to your faithful people.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said, “I have raised up a warrior.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have selected him from the common people to be king.<br />&nbsp; I have found my servant David.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have anointed him with my holy oil.<br />&nbsp; I will steady him with my hand;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my powerful arm I will make him strong.<br />&nbsp; His enemies will not defeat him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will the wicked overpower him.<br />&nbsp; I will beat down his adversaries before him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroy those who hate him.<br />&nbsp; My faithfulness and unfailing love will be with him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by my authority he will grow in power.<br />&nbsp; I will extend his rule over the sea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his dominion over the rivers.<br />&nbsp; And he will call out to me, ‘You are my Father,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my God, and the Rock of my salvation.’<br />&nbsp; I will make him my firstborn son,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mightiest king on earth.<br />&nbsp; I will love him and be kind to him forever;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my covenant with him will never end.<br />&nbsp; I will preserve an heir for him;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his throne will be as endless as the days of heaven.<br />&nbsp; But if his descendants forsake my instructions<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fail to obey my regulations,<br />&nbsp; if they do not obey my decrees<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fail to keep my commands,<br />&nbsp; then I will punish their sin with the rod,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their disobedience with beating.<br />&nbsp; But I will never stop loving him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor fail to keep my promise to him.<br />&nbsp; No, I will not break my covenant;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not take back a single word I said.<br />&nbsp; I have sworn an oath to David,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in my holiness I cannot lie:<br />&nbsp; His dynasty will go on forever;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his kingdom will endure as the sun.<br />&nbsp; It will be as eternal as the moon,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my faithful witness in the sky!”<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Interlude</i><br /><p />&nbsp;

You have broken down the walls protecting him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ruined every fort defending him.<br />&nbsp; Everyone who comes along has robbed him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he has become a joke to his neighbors.<br />&nbsp; You have strengthened his enemies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made them all rejoice.<br />&nbsp; You have made his sword useless<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refused to help him in battle.<br />&nbsp;
