Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them.  Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity.  This is good and pleases God our Savior,  who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth.  For there is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity—the man Christ Jesus.  He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time.  And I have been chosen as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles this message about faith and truth. I’m not exaggerating—just telling the truth.<p />&nbsp; In every place of worship, I want men to pray with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy.<p />&nbsp; And I want women to be modest in their appearance.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes.  For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do.<p />&nbsp; Women should learn quietly and submissively.  I do not let women teach men or have authority over them.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> Let them listen quietly.  For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve.  And it was not Adam who was deceived by Satan. The woman was deceived, and sin was the result.  But women will be saved through childbearing,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> assuming they continue to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
