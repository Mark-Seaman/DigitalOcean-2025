But when Peter arrived back in Jerusalem, the Jewish believers<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> criticized him.  “You entered the home of Gentiles<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and even ate with them!” they said.<p />&nbsp; Then Peter told them exactly what had happened.  “I was in the town of Joppa,” he said, “and while I was praying, I went into a trance and saw a vision. Something like a large sheet was let down by its four corners from the sky. And it came right down to me.  When I looked inside the sheet, I saw all sorts of small animals, wild animals, reptiles, and birds.  And I heard a voice say, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat them.’<p />&nbsp; “‘No, Lord,’ I replied. ‘I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure or unclean.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>’<p />&nbsp; “But the voice from heaven spoke again: ‘Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean.’  This happened three times before the sheet and all it contained was pulled back up to heaven.<p />&nbsp; “Just then three men who had been sent from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were staying.  The Holy Spirit told me to go with them and not to worry that they were Gentiles. These six brothers here accompanied me, and we soon entered the home of the man who had sent for us.  He told us how an angel had appeared to him in his home and had told him, ‘Send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter.  He will tell you how you and everyone in your household can be saved!’<p />&nbsp; “As I began to speak,” Peter continued, “the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as he fell on us at the beginning.  Then I thought of the Lord’s words when he said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>‘John baptized with<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</font>  And since God gave these Gentiles the same gift he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God’s way?”<p />&nbsp; When the others heard this, they stopped objecting and began praising God. They said, “We can see that God has also given the Gentiles the privilege of repenting of their sins and receiving eternal life.”<h5>The Church in Antioch of Syria</h5>&nbsp; Meanwhile, the believers who had been scattered during the persecution after Stephen’s death traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch of Syria. They preached the word of God, but only to Jews.  However, some of the believers who went to Antioch from Cyprus and Cyrene began preaching to the Gentiles<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> about the Lord Jesus.  The power of the Lord was with them, and a large number of these Gentiles believed and turned to the Lord.<p />&nbsp; When the church at Jerusalem heard what had happened, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  When he arrived and saw this evidence of God’s blessing, he was filled with joy, and he encouraged the believers to stay true to the Lord.  Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and strong in faith. And many people were brought to the Lord.<p />&nbsp; Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to look for Saul.  When he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. Both of them stayed there with the church for a full year, teaching large crowds of people. (It was at Antioch that the believers<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> were first called Christians.)<p />&nbsp; During this time some prophets traveled from Jerusalem to Antioch.  One of them named Agabus stood up in one of the meetings and predicted by the Spirit that a great famine was coming upon the entire Roman world. (This was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius.)  So the believers in Antioch decided to send relief to the brothers and sisters<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> in Judea, everyone giving as much as they could.  This they did, entrusting their gifts to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders of the church in Jerusalem.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
