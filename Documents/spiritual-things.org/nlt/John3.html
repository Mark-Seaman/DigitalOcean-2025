After dark one evening, he came to speak with Jesus. “Rabbi,” he said, “we all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you the truth, unless you are born again,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> you cannot see the Kingdom of God.”</font><p />&nbsp; “What do you mean?” exclaimed Nicodemus. “How can an old man go back into his mother’s womb and be born again?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I assure you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Humans can reproduce only human life, but the Holy Spirit gives birth to spiritual life.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So don’t be surprised when I say, ‘You<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> must be born again.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can’t tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can’t explain how people are born of the Spirit.”</font><p />&nbsp; “How are these things possible?” Nicodemus asked.<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You are a respected Jewish teacher, and yet you don’t understand these things?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I assure you, we tell you what we know and have seen, and yet you won’t believe our testimony.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But if you don’t believe me when I tell you about earthly things, how can you possibly believe if I tell you about heavenly things?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>No one has ever gone to heaven and returned. But the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> has come down from heaven.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And as Moses lifted up the bronze snake on a pole in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God’s one and only Son.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And the judgment is based on this fact: God’s light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”</font><h5>John the Baptist Exalts Jesus</h5>&nbsp; Then Jesus and his disciples left Jerusalem and went into the Judean countryside. Jesus spent some time with them there, baptizing people.<p />&nbsp; At this time John the Baptist was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people kept coming to him for baptism.  (This was before John was thrown into prison.)  A debate broke out between John’s disciples and a certain Jew<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> over ceremonial cleansing.  So John’s disciples came to him and said, “Rabbi, the man you met on the other side of the Jordan River, the one you identified as the Messiah, is also baptizing people. And everybody is going to him instead of coming to us.”<p />&nbsp; John replied, “No one can receive anything unless God gives it from heaven.  You yourselves know how plainly I told you, ‘I am not the Messiah. I am only here to prepare the way for him.’  It is the bridegroom who marries the bride, and the best man is simply glad to stand with him and hear his vows. Therefore, I am filled with joy at his success.  He must become greater and greater, and I must become less and less.<p />&nbsp; “He has come from above and is greater than anyone else. We are of the earth, and we speak of earthly things, but he has come from heaven and is greater than anyone else.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>  He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but how few believe what he tells them!  Anyone who accepts his testimony can affirm that God is true.  For he is sent by God. He speaks God’s words, for God gives him the Spirit without limit.  The Father loves his Son and has put everything into his hands.  And anyone who believes in God’s Son has eternal life. Anyone who doesn’t obey the Son will never experience eternal life but remains under God’s angry judgment.”</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
