So he sent his disciples to ask Jesus,  “Are you the Messiah we’ve been expecting,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> or should we keep looking for someone else?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus told them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen—</font> <font class='woj' style='color:'>the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And tell him, ‘God blesses those who do not turn away because of me.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>’”</font><p />&nbsp; As John’s disciples were leaving, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people with expensive clothes live in palaces.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Were you looking for a prophet? Yes, and he is more than a prophet.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>‘Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and he will prepare your way before you.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you the truth, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and violent people are attacking it.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For before John came, all the prophets and the law of Moses looked forward to this present time.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And if you are willing to accept what I say, he is Elijah, the one the prophets said would come.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“To what can I compare this generation? It is like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends,</font><font class='woj' style='color:'><p />&nbsp; ‘We played wedding songs,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and you didn’t dance,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>so we played funeral songs,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and you didn’t mourn.’</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>For John didn’t spend his time eating and drinking, and you say, ‘He’s possessed by a demon.’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The Son of Man,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, ‘He’s a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!’ But wisdom is shown to be right by its results.”</font><h5>Judgment for the Unbelievers</h5>&nbsp; Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where he had done so many of his miracles, because they hadn’t repented of their sins and turned to God.  <font class='woj' style='color:'>“What sorrow awaits you, Korazin and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon, their people would have repented of their sins long ago, clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you, Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“And you people of Capernaum, will you be honored in heaven? No, you will go down to the place of the dead.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> For if the miracles I did for you had been done in wicked Sodom, it would still be here today.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you, even Sodom will be better off on judgment day than you.”</font><h5>Jesus’ Prayer of Thanksgiving</h5>&nbsp; At that time Jesus prayed this prayer: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“My Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then Jesus said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
