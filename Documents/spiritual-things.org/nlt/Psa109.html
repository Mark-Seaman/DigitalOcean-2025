while the wicked slander me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and tell lies about me.<br />&nbsp; They surround me with hateful words<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fight against me for no reason.<br />&nbsp; I love them, but they try to destroy me with accusations<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even as I am praying for them!<br />&nbsp; They repay evil for good,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hatred for my love.<p />&nbsp; They say,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> “Get an evil person to turn against him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Send an accuser to bring him to trial.<br />&nbsp; When his case comes up for judgment,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him be pronounced guilty.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count his prayers as sins.<br />&nbsp; Let his years be few;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let someone else take his position.<br />&nbsp; May his children become fatherless,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his wife a widow.<br />&nbsp; May his children wander as beggars<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be driven from their ruined homes.<br />&nbsp; May creditors seize his entire estate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and strangers take all he has earned.<br />&nbsp; Let no one be kind to him;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let no one pity his fatherless children.<br />&nbsp; May all his offspring die.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May his family name be blotted out in a single generation.<br />&nbsp; May the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> never forget the sins of his fathers;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may his mother’s sins never be erased from the record.<br />&nbsp; May the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> always remember these sins,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and may his name disappear from human memory.<br />&nbsp; For he refused all kindness to others;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he persecuted the poor and needy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he hounded the brokenhearted to death.<br />&nbsp; He loved to curse others;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now you curse him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never blessed others;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now don’t you bless him.<br />&nbsp; Cursing is as natural to him as his clothing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the water he drinks,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the rich food he eats.<br />&nbsp; Now may his curses return and cling to him like clothing;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may they be tied around him like a belt.”<p />&nbsp; May those curses become the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s punishment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my accusers who speak evil of me.<br />&nbsp; But deal well with me, O Sovereign L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the sake of your own reputation!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescue me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you are so faithful and good.<br />&nbsp; For I am poor and needy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my heart is full of pain.<br />&nbsp; I am fading like a shadow at dusk;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am brushed off like a locust.<br />&nbsp; My knees are weak from fasting,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am skin and bones.<br />&nbsp; I am a joke to people everywhere;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn.<p />&nbsp; Help me, O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> my God!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save me because of your unfailing love.<br />&nbsp; Let them see that this is your doing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you yourself have done it, L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; Then let them curse me if they like,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you will bless me!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they attack me, they will be disgraced!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I, your servant, will go right on rejoicing!<br />&nbsp; May my accusers be clothed with disgrace;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may their humiliation cover them like a cloak.<br />&nbsp; But I will give repeated thanks to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praising him to everyone.<br />&nbsp; For he stands beside the needy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready to save them from those who condemn them.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
