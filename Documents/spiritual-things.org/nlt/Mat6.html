Don’t do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When you give to someone in need, don’t do as the hypocrites do—blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you the truth, they have received all the reward they will ever get.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But when you give to someone in need, don’t let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Give your gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.</font><h5>Teaching about Prayer and Fasting</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“When you pray, don’t be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“When you pray, don’t babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Don’t be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Pray like this:</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>Our Father in heaven,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>may your name be kept holy.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'> May your Kingdom come soon.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>May your will be done on earth,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>as it is in heaven.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'> Give us today the food we need,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'> and forgive us our sins,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>as we have forgiven those who sin against us.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'> And don’t let us yield to temptation,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>but rescue us from the evil one.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“And when you fast, don’t make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will ever get.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows what you do in private. And your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.</font><h5>Teaching about Money and Possessions</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Don’t store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But when your eye is bad, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life—whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn’t life more than food, and your body more than clothing?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Look at the birds. They don’t plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren’t you far more valuable to him than they are?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“So don’t worry about these things, saying, ‘What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?’</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Seek the Kingdom of God<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> above all else, and live righteously, and he will give you everything you need.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“So don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today’s trouble is enough for today.</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
