Since it was the Sabbath, Jesus’ enemies watched him closely. If he healed the man’s hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.<p />&nbsp; Jesus said to the man with the deformed hand, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Come and stand in front of everyone.”</font>  Then he turned to his critics and asked, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?”</font> But they wouldn’t answer him.<p />&nbsp; He looked around at them angrily and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Hold out your hand.”</font> So the man held out his hand, and it was restored!  At once the Pharisees went away and met with the supporters of Herod to plot how to kill Jesus.<h5>Crowds Follow Jesus</h5>&nbsp; Jesus went out to the lake with his disciples, and a large crowd followed him. They came from all over Galilee, Judea,  Jerusalem, Idumea, from east of the Jordan River, and even from as far north as Tyre and Sidon. The news about his miracles had spread far and wide, and vast numbers of people came to see him.<p />&nbsp; Jesus instructed his disciples to have a boat ready so the crowd would not crush him.  He had healed many people that day, so all the sick people eagerly pushed forward to touch him.  And whenever those possessed by evil<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> spirits caught sight of him, the spirits would throw them to the ground in front of him shrieking, “You are the Son of God!”  But Jesus sternly commanded the spirits not to reveal who he was.<h5>Jesus Chooses the Twelve Apostles</h5>&nbsp; Afterward Jesus went up on a mountain and called out the ones he wanted to go with him. And they came to him.  Then he appointed twelve of them and called them his apostles.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> They were to accompany him, and he would send them out to preach,  giving them authority to cast out demons.  These are the twelve he chose:<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon (whom he named Peter),<br />&nbsp; James and John (the sons of Zebedee, but Jesus nicknamed them “Sons of Thunder”<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>),<br />&nbsp; Andrew,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bartholomew,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James (son of Alphaeus),<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaddaeus,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon (the zealot<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>),<br />&nbsp; Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).<h5>Jesus and the Prince of Demons</h5>&nbsp; One time Jesus entered a house, and the crowds began to gather again. Soon he and his disciples couldn’t even find time to eat.  When his family heard what was happening, they tried to take him away. “He’s out of his mind,” they said.<p />&nbsp; But the teachers of religious law who had arrived from Jerusalem said, “He’s possessed by Satan,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> the prince of demons. That’s where he gets the power to cast out demons.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus called them over and responded with an illustration. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“How can Satan cast out Satan?”</font> he asked.  <font class='woj' style='color:'>“A kingdom divided by civil war will collapse.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Similarly, a family splintered by feuding will fall apart.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And if Satan is divided and fights against himself, how can he stand? He would never survive.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Let me illustrate this further. Who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man like Satan and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger—someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“I tell you the truth, all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. This is a sin with eternal consequences.”</font>  He told them this because they were saying, “He’s possessed by an evil spirit.”<h5>The True Family of Jesus</h5>&nbsp; Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him. They stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them.  There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and someone said, “Your mother and your brothers<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> are outside asking for you.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?”</font>  Then he looked at those around him and said, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Look, these are my mother and brothers.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Anyone who does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
