A large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat there and taught as the people stood on the shore.  He told many stories in the form of parables, such as this one:<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>“Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seeds.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>As he scattered them across his field, some seeds fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate them.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Other seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun, and since they didn’t have deep roots, they died.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Other seeds fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.”</font><p />&nbsp; His disciples came and asked him, “Why do you use parables when you talk to the people?”<p />&nbsp; He replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“You are permitted to understand the secrets<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> of the Kingdom of Heaven, but others are not.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given, and they will have an abundance of knowledge. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>That is why I use these parables,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>For they look, but they don’t really see.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>They hear, but they don’t really listen or understand.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah that says,</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>‘When you hear what I say,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>you will not understand.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>When you see what I do,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>you will not comprehend.</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'> For the hearts of these people are hardened,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and their ears cannot hear,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and they have closed their eyes—</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>so their eyes cannot see,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and their ears cannot hear,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and their hearts cannot understand,</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and they cannot turn to me</font><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>and let me heal them.’<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup></font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, but they didn’t see it. And they longed to hear what you hear, but they didn’t hear it.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Now listen to the explanation of the parable about the farmer planting seeds:</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message about the Kingdom and don’t understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches away the seed that was planted in their hearts.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But since they don’t have deep roots, they don’t last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God’s word.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The seed that fell among the thorns represents those who hear God’s word, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth, so no fruit is produced.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God’s word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!”</font><h5>Parable of the Wheat and Weeds</h5>&nbsp; Here is another story Jesus told: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But that night as the workers slept, his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat, then slipped away.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When the crop began to grow and produce grain, the weeds also grew.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The farmer’s workers went to him and said, ‘Sir, the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds! Where did they come from?’</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“‘An enemy has done this!’ the farmer exclaimed.</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font class='woj' style='color:'>“‘Should we pull out the weeds?’ they asked.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“‘No,’ he replied, ‘you’ll uproot the wheat if you do.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.’”</font><h5>Parable of the Mustard Seed</h5>&nbsp; Here is another illustration Jesus used: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>It is the smallest of all seeds, but it becomes the largest of garden plants; it grows into a tree, and birds come and make nests in its branches.”</font><h5>Parable of the Yeast</h5>&nbsp; Jesus also used this illustration: <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour, it permeated every part of the dough.”</font><p />&nbsp; Jesus always used stories and illustrations like these when speaking to the crowds. In fact, he never spoke to them without using such parables.  This fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet:<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will speak to you in parables.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will explain things hidden since the creation of the world.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”<h5>Parable of the Wheat and Weeds Explained</h5>&nbsp; Then, leaving the crowds outside, Jesus went into the house. His disciples said, “Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field.”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> is the farmer who plants the good seed.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The field is the world, and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The enemy who planted the weeds among the wheat is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> and the harvesters are the angels.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Just as the weeds are sorted out and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the world.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his Kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>And the angels will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father’s Kingdom. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!</font><h5>Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field. In his excitement, he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for choice pearls.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When he discovered a pearl of great value, he sold everything he owned and bought it!</font><h5>Parable of the Fishing Net</h5>&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a fishing net that was thrown into the water and caught fish of every kind.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>When the net was full, they dragged it up onto the shore, sat down, and sorted the good fish into crates, but threw the bad ones away.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>That is the way it will be at the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked people from the righteous,</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>throwing the wicked into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Do you understand all these things?”</font><p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yes,” they said, “we do.”<p />&nbsp; Then he added, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Every teacher of religious law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a homeowner who brings from his storeroom new gems of truth as well as old.”</font><h5>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth</h5>&nbsp; When Jesus had finished telling these stories and illustrations, he left that part of the country.  He returned to Nazareth, his hometown. When he taught there in the synagogue, everyone was amazed and said, “Where does he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?”  Then they scoffed, “He’s just the carpenter’s son, and we know Mary, his mother, and his brothers—James, Joseph,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> Simon, and Judas.  All his sisters live right here among us. Where did he learn all these things?”  And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Jesus told them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his own family.”</font>  And so he did only a few miracles there because of their unbelief.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
