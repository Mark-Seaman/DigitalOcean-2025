Sing to him; yes, sing his praises.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell everyone about his wonderful deeds.<br />&nbsp; Exult in his holy name;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoice, you who worship the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp; Search for the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and for his strength;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continually seek him.<br />&nbsp; Remember the wonders he has performed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his miracles, and the rulings he has given,<br />&nbsp; you children of his servant Abraham,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you descendants of Jacob, his chosen ones.<p />&nbsp; He is the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> our God.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His justice is seen throughout the land.<br />&nbsp; He always stands by his covenant—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the commitment he made to a thousand generations.<br />&nbsp; This is the covenant he made with Abraham<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the oath he swore to Isaac.<br />&nbsp; He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the people of Israel as a never-ending covenant:<br />&nbsp; “I will give you the land of Canaan<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as your special possession.”<p />&nbsp; He said this when they were few in number,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.<br />&nbsp; They wandered from nation to nation,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from one kingdom to another.<br />&nbsp; Yet he did not let anyone oppress them.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He warned kings on their behalf:<br />&nbsp; “Do not touch my chosen people,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not hurt my prophets.”<p />&nbsp; He called for a famine on the land of Canaan,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cutting off its food supply.<br />&nbsp; Then he sent someone to Egypt ahead of them—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph, who was sold as a slave.<br />&nbsp; They bruised his feet with fetters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and placed his neck in an iron collar.<br />&nbsp; Until the time came to fulfill his dreams,<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> tested Joseph’s character.<br />&nbsp; Then Pharaoh sent for him and set him free;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ruler of the nation opened his prison door.<br />&nbsp; Joseph was put in charge of all the king’s household;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he became ruler over all the king’s possessions.<br />&nbsp; He could instruct the king’s aides as he pleased<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and teach the king’s advisers.<p />&nbsp; Then Israel arrived in Egypt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.<br />&nbsp; And the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> multiplied the people of Israel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until they became too mighty for their enemies.<br />&nbsp; Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they plotted against the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>’s servants.<p />&nbsp; But the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> sent his servant Moses,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br />&nbsp; They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wonders in the land of Ham.<br />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> blanketed Egypt in darkness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they had defied his commands to let his people go.<br />&nbsp; He turned their water into blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poisoning all the fish.<br />&nbsp; Then frogs overran the land<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and even invaded the king’s bedrooms.<br />&nbsp; When the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> spoke, flies descended on the Egyptians,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gnats swarmed across Egypt.<br />&nbsp; He sent them hail instead of rain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lightning flashed over the land.<br />&nbsp; He ruined their grapevines and fig trees<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shattered all the trees.<br />&nbsp; He spoke, and hordes of locusts came—<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young locusts beyond number.<br />&nbsp; They ate up everything green in the land,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroying all the crops in their fields.<br />&nbsp; Then he killed the oldest son in each Egyptian home,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pride and joy of each family.<p />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> brought his people out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled.<br />&nbsp; Egypt was glad when they were gone,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they feared them greatly.<br />&nbsp; The L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> spread a cloud above them as a covering<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave them a great fire to light the darkness.<br />&nbsp; They asked for meat, and he sent them quail;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he satisfied their hunger with manna—bread from heaven.<br />&nbsp; He split open a rock, and water gushed out<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to form a river through the dry wasteland.<br />&nbsp; For he remembered his sacred promise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to his servant Abraham.<br />&nbsp; So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his chosen ones with rejoicing.<br />&nbsp; He gave his people the lands of pagan nations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they harvested crops that others had planted.<br />&nbsp; All this happened so they would follow his decrees<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and obey his instructions.<p />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>!</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
