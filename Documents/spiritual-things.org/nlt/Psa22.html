My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you so far away when I groan for help?<br />&nbsp; Every day I call to you, my God, but you do not answer.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every night you hear my voice, but I find no relief.<p />&nbsp; Yet you are holy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enthroned on the praises of Israel.<br />&nbsp; Our ancestors trusted in you,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you rescued them.<br />&nbsp; They cried out to you and were saved.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They trusted in you and were never disgraced.<p />&nbsp; But I am a worm and not a man.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am scorned and despised by all!<br />&nbsp; Everyone who sees me mocks me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sneer and shake their heads, saying,<br />&nbsp; “Is this the one who relies on the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then let the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> save him!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> loves him so much,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> rescue him!”<p />&nbsp; Yet you brought me safely from my mother’s womb<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and led me to trust you at my mother’s breast.<br />&nbsp; I was thrust into your arms at my birth.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have been my God from the moment I was born.<p />&nbsp; Do not stay so far from me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for trouble is near,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one else can help me.<br />&nbsp; My enemies surround me like a herd of bulls;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fierce bulls of Bashan have hemmed me in!<br />&nbsp; Like lions they open their jaws against me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roaring and tearing into their prey.<br />&nbsp; My life is poured out like water,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all my bones are out of joint.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart is like wax,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;melting within me.<br />&nbsp; My strength has dried up like sunbaked clay.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have laid me in the dust and left me for dead.<br />&nbsp; My enemies surround me like a pack of dogs;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an evil gang closes in on me.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have pierced my hands and feet.<br />&nbsp; I can count all my bones.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My enemies stare at me and gloat.<br />&nbsp; They divide my garments among themselves<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and throw dice<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> for my clothing.<p />&nbsp; O L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, do not stay far away!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are my strength; come quickly to my aid!<br />&nbsp; Save me from the sword;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spare my precious life from these dogs.<br />&nbsp; Snatch me from the lion’s jaws<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the horns of these wild oxen.<p />&nbsp; I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters.<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will praise you among your assembled people.<br />&nbsp; Praise the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>, all you who fear him!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honor him, all you descendants of Jacob!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show him reverence, all you descendants of Israel!<br />&nbsp; For he has not ignored or belittled the suffering of the needy.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has not turned his back on them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but has listened to their cries for help.<p />&nbsp; I will praise you in the great assembly.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will fulfill my vows in the presence of those who worship you.<br />&nbsp; The poor will eat and be satisfied.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who seek the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> will praise him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hearts will rejoice with everlasting joy.<br />&nbsp; The whole earth will acknowledge the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span> and return to him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the families of the nations will bow down before him.<br />&nbsp; For royal power belongs to the L<span style="font-variant:small-caps">ord</span>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rules all the nations.<p />&nbsp; Let the rich of the earth feast and worship.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bow before him, all who are mortal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all whose lives will end as dust.<br />&nbsp; Our children will also serve him.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Future generations will hear about the wonders of the Lord.<br />&nbsp; His righteous acts will be told to those not yet born.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will hear about everything he has done.</p><p /><div class="footnotes">
