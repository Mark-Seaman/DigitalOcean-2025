Who has sorrow?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is always fighting? Who is always complaining?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has unnecessary bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?<br />&nbsp; It is the one who spends long hours in the taverns,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trying out new drinks.<br />&nbsp; Don’t gaze at the wine, seeing how red it is,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how it sparkles in the cup, how smoothly it goes down.<br />&nbsp; For in the end it bites like a poisonous snake;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it stings like a viper.<br />&nbsp; You will see hallucinations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you will say crazy things.<br />&nbsp; You will stagger like a sailor tossed at sea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clinging to a swaying mast.<br />&nbsp; And you will say, “They hit me, but I didn’t feel it.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn’t even know it when they beat me up.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When will I wake up<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I can look for another drink?”</p><p />
