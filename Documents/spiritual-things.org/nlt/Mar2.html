Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room, even outside the door. While he was preaching God’s word to them,  four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat.  They couldn’t bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they dug a hole through the roof above his head. Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus.  Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“My child, your sins are forgiven.”</font><p />&nbsp; But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves,  “What is he saying? This is blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!”<p />&nbsp; Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, so he asked them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Why do you question this in your hearts?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or ‘Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk’?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So I will prove to you that the Son of Man<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> has the authority on earth to forgive sins.”</font> Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said,  <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!”</font><p />&nbsp; And the man jumped up, grabbed his mat, and walked out through the stunned onlookers. They were all amazed and praised God, exclaiming, “We’ve never seen anything like this before!”<h5>Jesus Calls Levi (Matthew)</h5>&nbsp; Then Jesus went out to the lakeshore again and taught the crowds that were coming to him.  As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at his tax collector’s booth. <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Follow me and be my disciple,”</font> Jesus said to him. So Levi got up and followed him.<p />&nbsp; Later, Levi invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners. (There were many people of this kind among Jesus’ followers.)  But when the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup> saw him eating with tax collectors and other sinners, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with such scum?<sup class='footnote' value=''></sup>”<p />&nbsp; When Jesus heard this, he told them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Healthy people don’t need a doctor—sick people do. I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners.”</font><h5>A Discussion about Fasting</h5>&nbsp; Once when John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people came to Jesus and asked, “Why don’t your disciples fast like John’s disciples and the Pharisees do?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus replied, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. They can’t fast while the groom is with them.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Besides, who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth, leaving an even bigger tear than before.</font><p />&nbsp; <font class='woj' style='color:'>“And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the wine would burst the wineskins, and the wine and the skins would both be lost. New wine calls for new wineskins.”</font><h5>A Discussion about the Sabbath</h5>&nbsp; One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat.  But the Pharisees said to Jesus, “Look, why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?”<p />&nbsp; Jesus said to them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“Haven’t you ever read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>He went into the house of God (during the days when Abiathar was high priest) and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat. He also gave some to his companions.”</font><p />&nbsp; Then Jesus said to them, <font class='woj' style='color:'>“The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.</font>  <font class='woj' style='color:'>So the Son of Man is Lord, even over the Sabbath!”</font></p><p /><div class="footnotes">
