Call to Transformation
    I have my plans
        Healthy
        Wealthy
        Powerful
        Comfortable

    God has his plans
        His are different than mine
        Unavoidable conflict
        God will not change
        No amount of self-effort

    Deep transformation
        Mental
        Emotional
        Social
        Spiritual

    Lifelong journey
        Always growing
        Never finished
        Death is a doorway 
        Experience God here and now
