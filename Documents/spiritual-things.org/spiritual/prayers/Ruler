# Ruler of Rulers
by Mark Seaman

    Ruler of Rulers
    Nations rise and nations fall
    Cultures emerge and cultures crumble
    Keep my heart pure
    Not worshiping any false gods

    Even though I am surrounded by 
    Lust for Wealth and Power
    Keep my heart pure
    Not worshiping any false gods

    I live among those who crave riches
    Enough to bring violence upon the helpless
    Economy & Politics
    Materialism & Militarism
    Money & Control
    Dollars & Guns
    Wealth & Power
    Always together, supporting each other
    The way of Humans - The way of Hell

    Ruler of Rulers
    Prince of Peace
    The Lamb of God
    Come to slay the Dragon, Whore, and Beast
    Come to plunder the Devil, Empire, and Tyrants
    Come to set your people free
    Come to end the violence

    Free us from idolatry
    Free your people
    Do not let us be seduced by the Dragon, Whore, and Beast
    For that path is wide and ends poorly
    Keep our hearts pure
    Not worshiping any false gods

    Let a new song arise
    Not a battle cry for more wealth and power
    But a cry of celebration
    The Lamb has slain the Dragon
    And the Prince of Peace reigns
    The kingdoms of this world
    Have become the Kingdom of the Lamb
    God's people celebrate!
