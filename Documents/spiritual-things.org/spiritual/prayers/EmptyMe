# Empty and Filled

Empty me and fill the void with the Spirit

I derive a lot of identify from what I do: Learn, Plan, Build, Teach

I lay down my knowledge
to accept God's wisdom

I lay down my goals
to be filled with God's purpose

I lay down my solutions
to commit to God's activities

I lay down my relationships
to see people as God sees them
