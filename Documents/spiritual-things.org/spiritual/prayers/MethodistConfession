# Methodist Prayer of Confession

All powerful and merciful Father, I have strayed from your ways like a lost sheep.

I have followed the selfish desires of my own heart and have disobeyed your plan for me.

I have left undone things I ought to have done; and done those things
which I should not have done; and my motivations have become corrupt.

Lord, have mercy upon me, and spare me as I confess my sin.

You restore those who repent; according to your promises in Jesus our Lord.

Help me live a godly, righteous, and joyful life for your glory.

Amen
