# Hands Prayer

Hands are extended palms down to symbolize letting go.
Palms are raised to embody a posture of receiving.

All I am ... Lord I commit my life to you.

I release my exceptions to you...

* My work
* My health
* My relationships
* My dreams

They are yours.

Make my life exactly what you intend for me.

Help me fully become the person that you have created me to be.
