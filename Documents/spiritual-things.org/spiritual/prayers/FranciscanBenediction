# A Franciscan Benediction

    May God bless you with discomfort
    At easy answers, half-truths, and superficial relationships
    So that you may live deep within your heart.

    May God bless you with anger
    At injustice, oppression, and exploitation of people,
    So that you may work for justice, freedom and peace.

    May God bless you with tears
    To shed for those who suffer pain, rejection, hunger and war,
    So that you may reach out your hand to comfort them and
    To turn their pain into joy.

    And may God bless you with enough foolishness
    To believe that you can make a difference in the world,
    So that you can do what other claim cannot be done
    To bring justice and kindness to all our children and the poor.
