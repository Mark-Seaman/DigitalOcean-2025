# God Speaks through Psalm 23

I care for you like a shepherd cares for his sheep. I will give you everything
that you ever need. I give you rest when you need it. You can find refuge in my
presence. I will take you to pleasant places of comfort and peace to allow your
strength to be renewed.

Where you go is a reflection of my reputation and work within you. Choose
wisely. How you live influences others. Seek the high road. This brings me honor
and is an act of worship.

When life takes a bad turn I will be there to bring comfort and strength. I will
walk you through every frightening experience. You will never have to be alone.

My authority and protection will cover you in every situation. You will overcome
every enemy that you face. You will bask in victory for my power will be upon
you.

You will live a rich life, filled with all of my blessings. My goodness and love
will envelop you throughout your life. My presence will be a constant companion.
