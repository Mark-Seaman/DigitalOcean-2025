# I need more of You

Dear Father,

I humbly request more of your presence in my life, not because I deserve it, 
but according to your fantastic mercy.

I want to know You more and spend more time with You.

Prayer is a tool that You have given me to reach out and connect.

I desire to truly understand the way that You think about things and to see things
from Your perspective.

Speak Your truth to me and allow the Spirit to penetrate the recesses of my soul,
especially the most hidden places.

Teach me Your viewpoint on the issues that I struggle with the most.

Speak to me to bring encouragement, conviction, and passion into my heart.

I want to trust You at a deeper level than ever before.

I leave behind my own self effort, in favor of having Your life within.
