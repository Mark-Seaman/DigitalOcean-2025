# Work Prayer

Let me see my work through the eyes of Jesus.

I want my work life to be an act of worship.

Help me to love people the way that you do.

Teach me to be a representative of your kingdom.

Make me an example that others will emulate.

Remind me when it is time to lay down my goals in deference to others.

Show me the serving opportunities that you have given me.

Let me always extend mercy and forgiveness.

Suppress criticism and judgmental attitudes.

Give me humility, help me to admit when I am wrong.

Show me the courage to make changes where needed.

Allow me to be at peace by fully trusting you.
