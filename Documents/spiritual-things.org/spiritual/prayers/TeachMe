# Teach Me

by Mark Seaman

---

Your ways are not my ways.

Teach me to feel what you feel.

Teach me to love what you love.

Teach me to see what you see.

Teach me justice ...

- Defending the helpless
- Making things right

Teach me compassion ...

- To feel for those who suffer
- To sacrifice to bring relief

Teach me humility ...

- It's not about me
- I can do nothing on my own

Teach me

- to do what you do
- to say what you say
- to think what you think
- to feel what you feel

I want to be wholly transformed,<br>
and transformed to be holy.
