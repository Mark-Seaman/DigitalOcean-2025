# Calvin's Prayer 

Lord our God, as you have given us the night for rest and created the day for
your glory, let the remembrance of your goodness be always on our minds and the
gift of your love forever in our hearts. 

Keep us free from sin, protect us in the hour of temptation and guide us with
the light of your presence; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.

John Calvin (1509-1564)
