### Week 4 - Connecting to Jesus - Rachel Dawson  - Feb 21, 2021

**Scripture**

Mark 2:1-11

1-5 After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and word got around that he was back home. A crowd gathered, jamming the entrance so no one could get in or out. He was teaching the Word. They brought a paraplegic to him, carried by four men. When they weren't able to get in because of the crowd, they removed part of the roof and lowered the paraplegic on his stretcher. Impressed by their bold belief, Jesus said to the paraplegic, "Son, I forgive your sins.”

6-7 Some religion scholars sitting there started whispering among themselves, "He can't talk that way! That's blasphemy! God and only God can forgive sins.”

8-12 Jesus knew right away what they were thinking, and said, "Why are you so skeptical? Which is simpler: to say to the paraplegic, 'I forgive your sins,' or say, 'Get up, take your stretcher, and start walking'? Well, just so it's clear that I'm the Son of Man and authorized to do either, or both . . .” (he looked now at the paraplegic), "Get up. Pick up your stretcher and go home.” And the man did it—got up, grabbed his stretcher, and walked out, with everyone there watching him. They rubbed their eyes, stunned—and then praised God, saying, "We've never seen anything like this!”



**Notes**

This is a time of crisis for many of us.

It is difficult to navigate the challenges of life.

This life can be abundant but often hard, a mix of joy and sorrow.

We can't self-help our way to health.

Kingdom Connections get people to Jesus

Kingdom Connections are messy

Kingdom Connections are life giving

We all have prejudices that keep us from sharing the Jesus.

Jesus has the answers that people need.

But are you willing to get messy to get people to Jesus?

We need to respond to the crisis of the moment.

Comparisons are harmful for relationships.

We say, "Get cleaned up and then we can be close."

Jesus says, "Come as you are, I'll get you clean."



**Discussion Questions**

* What is your part to play?
* Are you willing to be used for others?
* How does comparison stop you from caring for others?
