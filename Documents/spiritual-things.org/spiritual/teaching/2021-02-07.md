**Scripture**

Nehemiah 1:1-11

1-2 The memoirs of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah.

It was the month of Kislev in the twentieth year. At the time I was in the
palace complex at Susa. Hanani, one of my brothers, had just arrived from Judah
with some fellow Jews. I asked them about the conditions among the Jews there
who had survived the exile, and about Jerusalem.

3 They told me, "The exile survivors who are left there in the province are in
bad shape. Conditions are appalling. The wall of Jerusalem is still rubble; the
city gates are still cinders.”

4 When I heard this, I sat down and wept. I mourned for days, fasting and
praying before the God-of-Heaven.

5-6 I said, "God, God-of-Heaven, the great and awesome God, loyal to his
covenant and faithful to those who love him and obey his commands: Look at me,
listen to me. Pay attention to this prayer of your servant that I'm praying day
and night in intercession for your servants, the People of Israel, confessing
the sins of the People of Israel. And I'm including myself, I and my ancestors,
among those who have sinned against you.

7-9 "We've treated you like dirt: We haven't done what you told us, haven't
followed your commands, and haven't respected the decisions you gave to Moses
your servant. All the same, remember the warning you posted to your servant
Moses: 'If you betray me, I'll scatter you to the four winds, but if you come
back to me and do what I tell you, I'll gather up all these scattered peoples
from wherever they ended up and put them back in the place I chose to mark with
my Name.'

10-11 "Well, there they are—your servants, your people whom you so powerfully
and impressively redeemed. O Master, listen to me, listen to your servant's
prayer—and yes, to all your servants who delight in honoring you—and make me
successful today so that I get what I want from the king.”

I was cupbearer to the king.


Nehemiah 2:1-5

1 It was the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king. At the
hour for serving wine I brought it in and gave it to the king. I had never been
hangdog in his presence before, so he asked me, "Why the long face? You're not
sick are you? Or are you depressed?”

2-3 That made me all the more agitated. I said, "Long live the king! And why
shouldn't I be depressed when the city, the city where all my family is buried,
is in ruins and the city gates have been reduced to cinders?”

4-5 The king then asked me, "So what do you want?”

Praying under my breath to the God-of-Heaven, I said, "If it please the king,
and if the king thinks well of me, send me to Judah, to the city where my family
is buried, so that I can rebuild it.”

  

**Notes**

Seeing

- Nehemiah chooses to see and decides to act
- To connect with yourself and God we must start with seeing the truth

Feeling

- Feeling means being moved by reality
- Emotion health will limit your spirituality
- Pain reveals truth
- Revelation demands repentance

Connecting

- Vulnerability is hard but required to truly live
- We must connect with ourselves before we can connect with others



**Discussion Questions**

* What new ways have you been able to see in the last year?
* What areas do you need to feel at a deeper level?
* How can you be more connected with yourself, God, and others?
