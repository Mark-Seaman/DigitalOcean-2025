## Emotionally Healthy Relationships

### Week 4 - Emotional Health - Rachel Dawson  - August 2, 2020

**Notes**

Our emotional life is like an iceberg where most of aspects are beneath the surface and hidden from us.

There is a gap between how Jesus wants me to live and how I actually live and love.  Emotional triggers often cause us to lose control and sin against others.  

There are many false answers to dealing with our emotions: pretend, medicate, Netflix binging, food, sex, control, etc..  We need to be aware of what is happening in order to gain true freedom.

Our emotional response often overwhelming our rational response to problems leading to even more pain.  The Bible contains many stories about how people deal with their emotions (well or not so well).
God invites us into health.

Truth transforms us from the inside out.  We see Jesus deal with very difficult emotions in the garden of Gethsemane.  He could have denied them but we see him embrace his emotions and submit.

God gives us gift to deal with our negative emotions - Solitude & Silence.   Pain compiles us to change.  It can be a great teacher.


**Discussion Questions**


* What area of your life is pain forcing you to grow?
