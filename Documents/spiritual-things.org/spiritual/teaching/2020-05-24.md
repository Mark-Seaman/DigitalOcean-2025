**Notes:**

To know who we are we must first know who the creator is.

O Lord, you are righteous, and your regulations are fair.  Your laws are 
perfect and completely trustworthy. I am overwhelmed with indignation, 
for my enemies have disregarded your words. Your promises have been 
thoroughly tested; that is why I love them so much. -- Psalms 119:137-140 NLT
    
What shapes us is not our desires but God's desires for us.

Many of us make decisions based on what brings us pleasure. We pursue what we
want, then we make sure that we are not violating any biblical command. We
want to not what God will tolerate rather than what brings him pleasure.

I pray with all my heart; answer me, Lord! I will obey your decrees. 
I cry out to you; rescue me, that I may obey your laws. -- Psalms 119:145-146 NLT

What does it mean to follow Christ.

* We admit that we have sinned.
* Repent and turn to God

Today when you hear his voice,  don't harden your hearts.
For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest 
two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. 
It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires. Nothing in all creation is 
hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he 
is the one to whom we are accountable.
-- Hebrews 4:7, 12

Maybe you are ready to experience the nearness of God.

**Discussion Questions:**

* What role does repentance play in learning about righteousness?
* How are we transformed into the Image of Christ?
