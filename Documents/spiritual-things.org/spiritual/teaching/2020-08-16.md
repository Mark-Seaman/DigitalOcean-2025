### Week 6 - Listening - Jenny Beilman  - August 16, 2020

**Scripture**

Be quick to listen and slow to speak -- Ja 1

Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit ... Php 2

Luke 24:17

Rejoice with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn. -- Ro 12:15


**Notes**

Being heard is so close to being loved that the two are indistiguishable.

We all have a need to be seen, heard, and known.

Being an introvert does not necessarily make you a good listener.

Most people do not listen with the intent to understand but more to reply. -- Seven Habits

Tips for listening

* value others above youself - everyone has value
    * distraction communicates lack of value
    * be present and invite others to connect
    * multitasking and listening can't happen together
* look to the interests of others
    * we often desire to dominate the conversation
    * we want to share our knowledge but not hear what others know
* we must be present
    * Jesus is our example of being present
    * embracing the pain of others allows God to work
    * it's good enough just to be there

The greatest need in our world is to be seen, heard, known, and loved.


**Discussion Questions**

* Describe a recent interaction where you failed to listen well.
* What are two ways that you can become a better listener?
* What is the impact on you when you feel you are truly heard?
