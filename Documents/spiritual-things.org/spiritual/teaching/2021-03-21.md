**Scripture**

Matthew 25:14-30

The Parable of the Bags of Gold

14 "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and
entrusted his wealth to them. 15 To one he gave five bags of gold, to another
two bags, and to another one bag,each according to his ability. Then he went on
his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put
his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags
of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a
hole in the ground and hid his master's money.

19 "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts
with them. 20 The  man who had received five bags of gold brought the other
five.  'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have 
gained five more.'

21 "His  master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been 
faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and
share your master's happiness!'

22 "The  man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted 
me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'

23 "His  master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been 
faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and
share your master's happiness!'

24 "Then  the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I 
knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and  gathering
where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your
gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'

26 "His  master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest 
where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 

27 Well  then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that
 when I returned I would have received it back with interest.

28 "'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags.
29 For  whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. 
Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw
that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.'



**Notes**

As we are reopening church we need to ask, "Is it back to normal, or is there
something better?"

We can either play Offense or Defense (by Reacting or Initiating)

Are we living life with purpose?

Problem with New Years resolutions

- conflict of different desires
- question the goal
- lose confidence

Parable in Mt 25

- Why did the servant hide the wealth instead of investing it?
- Go make disciples (sons & daughters)
- How can we invest the resources that we have received, to extend his kingdom



**Discussion Questions**

* When have you been unwilling to risk what God has entrusted to you?
* Why is it hard to take a risk?
* What is God inviting you to invest?
