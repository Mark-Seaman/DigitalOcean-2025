### Week 1 - Moving Forward or Backward - Todd Beilman  - March 7, 2021

**Scripture**

Ex 33:12-23

12-13 Moses said to God, "Look, you tell me, 'Lead this people,' but you don't let me know whom you're going to send with me. You tell me, 'I know you well and you are special to me.' If I am so special to you, let me in on your plans. That way, I will continue being special to you. Don't forget, this is your people, your responsibility.”

14 God said, "My presence will go with you. I'll see the journey to the end.”

15-16 Moses said, "If your presence doesn't take the lead here, call this trip off right now. How else will it be known that you're with me in this, with me and your people? Are you traveling with us or not? How else will we know that we're special, I and your people, among all other people on this planet Earth?”

17 God said to Moses: "All right. Just as you say; this also I will do, for I know you well and you are special to me. I know you by name.”

18 Moses said, "Please. Let me see your Glory.”

19 God said, "I will make my Goodness pass right in front of you; I'll call out the name, God, right before you. I'll treat well whomever I want to treat well and I'll be kind to whomever I want to be kind.”

20 God continued, "But you may not see my face. No one can see me and live.”

21-23 God said, "Look, here is a place right beside me. Put yourself on this rock. When my Glory passes by, I'll put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with my hand until I've passed by. Then I'll take my hand away and you'll see my back. But you won't see my face.”



**Notes**

Re-opening Christianity

Do we repurpose or replace?

- Keep
- Refurbish
- Get rid of

As things change we have a unique opportunity to assess how we do things

Are we moving forward or backward?

Trading the promise of God for the skewed memory of the past

We get a second chance



**Discussion Questions**

* Are you moving forward or backward?
* What is God challenging you to reexamine?
* How will you respond?
