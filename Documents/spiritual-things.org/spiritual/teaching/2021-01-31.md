### Week 1 - Disconnected - Todd Beilman  - Jan 31, 2021

**Scripture**

Heb 4:14-16

Now that we know what we have—Jesus, this great High Priest with ready access to
God—let's not let it slip through our fingers. We don't have a priest who is out
of touch with our reality. He's been through weakness and testing, experienced
it all—all but the sin. So let's walk right up to him and get what he is so
ready to give. Take the mercy, accept the help.


Mat 11:28

28-30 "Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away
with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest.
Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of
grace. I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you. Keep company with me
and you'll learn to live freely and lightly.”


  
**Notes**

When Todd's phone failed he was left disconnected.

We realize how awful it is to be disconnected from others.

What would it be like to be disconnected from God?

It has been a year of disconnection

Some have disconnected for ...

-  fear of getting sick
- fear of getting others sick
- disagreement
- dread
- fear of rejection

Connect through religion

Connect through relationship

- we learn from each other
- we pursue truth together
- we share our life story
- we are honest
- we are vulnerable to others
- we share joy and sorrow

We used to connect our TV through an antenna.

Then we connected with a cable.

Sometimes we seek connection that just does not work.

Jesus experienced the ultimate disconnection.

Sin can cause us to disconnect.

Satan is trying to disconnect you so that he can steal, kill, and destroy.

When you are alone you are not much of a threat.

We must wrestle with our burdens and learn to yield them to the Jesus.



**Discussion Questions**

* What connections do you want to have?
* What will you do to connect with others?
* What is stopping you?
