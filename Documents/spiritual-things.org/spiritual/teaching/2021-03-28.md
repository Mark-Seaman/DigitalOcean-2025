### Week 4 - For or Against - Todd Beilman  - March 28, 2021

**Scripture**

2 Co 12:9

But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power 
is made perfect in weakness.‚Äù Therefore I will boast all the more 
gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.

Mt 6:11-12

Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven our debtors.


**Notes**

We can be known for what we are "For" or what we are "Against".

Some people are very generous and free, while others are hostile and critical.

We all know what Jesus would do, but we frequently don't measure up.


**Discussion Questions**

* Are you known for what you are for or against?
* When have you done or said things that hurt someone else?
* How do you repair damage from actions you have done?
