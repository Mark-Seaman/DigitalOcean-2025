**Notes:**

The church needs to bring reassurance of God's presence and purpose not reasons why things are happening.

During the forty days after his crucifixion, Jesus appeared to the apostles from time to time, 
and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And he talked to them about the 
Kingdom of God.

Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, "Do not leave Jerusalem until the Father 
sends you the gift he promised, as I told you before. John baptized with water, but in just a 
few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”

On the day of Pentecost all the believers were meeting together in one place. Suddenly, there 
was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where 
they were sitting. Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on 
each of them. And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other 
languages, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.

Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that day—about 3,000 
in all.
All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to fellowship, and to 
sharing in meals (including the Lord's Supper), and to prayer.  A deep sense of awe came 
over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders. And all the 
believers met together in one place and shared everything they had.

They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. They 
worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord's Supper, and shared 
their meals with great joy and generosity— all the while praising God and enjoying the 
goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.
 
 -- Acts 2

**Discussion Questions:**

* How is God using you bring reassurance to others?
* Who are you listening to that is speaking of God's reconciliation?
* What is blocking this experience in your life?
