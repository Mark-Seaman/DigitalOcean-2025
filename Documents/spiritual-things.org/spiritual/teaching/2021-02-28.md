### Week 5 - Hearing from Jesus - Todd Beilman  - Feb 28, 2021


**Scripture**

Jn 14 -  MSG

1-4 "Don't  let this rattle you. You trust God, don't you? Trust me. There is  plenty of room for you in my Father's home. If that weren't so, would I  have told you that I'm on my way to get a room ready for you? And if I'm  on my way to get your room ready, I'll come back and get you so you can  live where I live. And you already know the road I'm taking.”

5 Thomas said, "Master, we have no idea where you're going. How do you expect us to know the road?”

6-7 Jesus  said, "I am the Road, also the Truth, also the Life. No one gets to the  Father apart from me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father  as well. From now on, you do know him. You've even seen him!”

8 Philip said, "Master, show us the Father; then we'll be content.”

9-10 "You've  been with me all this time, Philip, and you still don't understand? To  see me is to see the Father. So how can you ask, 'Where is the Father?'  Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The  words that I speak to you aren't mere words. I don't just make them up  on my own. The Father who resides in me crafts each word into a divine  act.

11-14 "Believe  me: I am in my Father and my Father is in me. If you can't believe  that, believe what you see—these works. The person who trusts me will  not only do what I'm doing but even greater things, because I, on my way  to the Father, am giving you the same work to do that I've been doing.  You can count on it. From now on, whatever you request along the lines  of who I am and what I am doing, I'll do it. That's how the Father will  be seen for who he is in the Son. I mean it. Whatever you request in  this way, I'll do.
