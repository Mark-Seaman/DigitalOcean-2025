## Emotionally Healthy Relationships

### Week 3 - False Expectations - Jose Pe√±a - July 26, 2020

**Notes**

Dealing with anger is a reflection of our emotional maturity.  Our spiritual maturity does not go beyond our emotional maturity.

God wants us to be his representatives in this world.  We must learn to react to others with love. God can give us love and compassion for those around us.

The story we tell has an impact on our feelings.  Having false expectations of others is making up a false story.

"Do not give false witness against your neighbor" - Exodus 20:16


**Discussion Questions**

When have you reacted automatically in anger and then realized that you were wrong?

When have you had unrealistic expectations of others?

What one relationship do you need God to transform?
