**Notes:**

The early church did not look like what we know today.  The church can take
on many different appearances.  The church is a fire that God starts but
can not be contained.

We are burning with that same fire. That can spread to impact the entire
world around us. We are the body of Christ and are discovering together
what God is doing with us.

Acts is a book filled with miracles and a people that were empowered to
take the good news to the world.

During the forty days after Jesus suffered and died, he appeared to the apostles 
from time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. 
And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.

Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, "Do not leave 
Jerusalem until the Father sends you the gift he promised, as I told 
you before. John baptized with water, but in just a few days you 
will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”
The Ascension of Jesus

So when the apostles were with Jesus, they kept asking him, "Lord, 
has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?”

He replied, "The Father alone has the authority to set those dates 
and times, and they are not for you to know. 8 But you will receive 
power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my 
witnesses, telling people about me everywhere — in Jerusalem, 
throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”  -- Act 1:3-8

Everything changes when God shows up in power.

**Discussion Questions:**

* When have you personally experienced the power and presence of the Holy Spirit?
* How has that changed your life?
