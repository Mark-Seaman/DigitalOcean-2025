## Emotionally Healthy Relationships

### Week 2 - Mind Reading - Jenny Beilman - July 19, 2020

**Notes**

Emotional health requires that we truly understand one another in order to love well.  One of the most harmful things that we do to in relationships is to make assumptions about what motivates others.

Instead of verifying our assumptions we use a harsh explanation of why they acted the way they did.  We make up a story without checking to see if it is even true.


**Discussion Questions**

When have you made assumptions about someone else that was incorrect?

When has someone else made an incorrect assumption about you?

What actions will help you to avoid false assumptions with others?
