# Is Jesus First?

My sense of well-being, happiness, security, and peace are more related to my relationship with
God than any circumstance.

Jesus is the rightful center of my attention. How is he involved in the following key areas?

* Spiritual - Personal growth & health
* Learn - Building knowledge and expertise
* Plan - What I do with my time, dealing with expectations
* Build - Problem solving and creating solutions
* Teach - Influencing others

These are the areas where my core values touch God plans for my life. Pray through each of these
areas regularly.
