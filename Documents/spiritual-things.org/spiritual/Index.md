# Spend Time Alone with God 

It is the most worthwhile endeavor possible.

Spiritual Things gives you resources to make your time more enjoyable, inspiring, and meaningful.

The website is constructed to offer up fresh content each day that will assist your devotional time.

The content is to be used to trigger a time of contemplation rather than simply consumed.

Meditations are organized in four general categories

* **[Pray](/spiritual/prayers/random)** - written prayers to use as a starting point for your own
* **[Reflect](/spiritual/reflect/random)** - questions for personal reflection
* **[Meditate](/spiritual/bible/random)** - meaningful scriptures to think about
* **[Journey](/book/Spiritual/Index)** - journey to discover truth
* **[Bible Gateway](https://biblegateway.com)** - New Testament ([NLT](nlt/index.html))


The menu on the right lets you pick a random selection from the library for today.

Bookmark or email the specific topic to return to the website.

I hope that you are deeply enriched by using Spiritual Things.  If you are invite your friends to join us.
